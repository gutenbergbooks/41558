<h2>DOROTHY DALE&rsquo;S GREAT SECRET</h2>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">AN AUTOMOBILE RIDE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing perfectly delightful about
boarding schools,&rdquo; declared Tavia, &ldquo;when the
term closes we can go away, and leave it in another
world. Now, at Dalton, we would have to see
the old schoolhouse every time we went to Daly&rsquo;s
for a pound of butter, a loaf of bread&mdash;and oh,
yes! I almost forgot! Mom said we could get
some bologna. Whew! Don&rsquo;t your mouth water,
Dorothy? We always did get good bologna
at Daly&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bologna!&rdquo; echoed Dorothy. &ldquo;As if the
young ladies of Glenwood School would disgrace
their appetites with such vulgar fare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she snatched up an empty cracker box,
almost devouring its parifine paper, in hopes of
finding a few more crumbs, although Tavia had
poured the last morsels of the wafers down her
own throat the night before this conversation took
place. Yes, Tavia had even made a funnel of the
paper and &ldquo;took&rdquo; the powdered biscuits as doctors
administer headache remedies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; went on Tavia, &ldquo;I distinctly
remember that you had a longing for the skin of
my sausage, along with the end piece, which you
always claimed for your own share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please stop!&rdquo; besought Dorothy, &ldquo;or I
shall have to purloin my hash from the table to-night
and stuff it into&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The armlet of your new, brown kid gloves,&rdquo;
finished Tavia. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the very color of a
nice, big, red-brown bologna, and I believe the inspiration
is a direct message. &lsquo;The Evolution of
a Bologna Sausage,&rsquo; modern edition, bound in full
kid. Mine for the other glove. Watch all the
hash within sight to-night, and we&rsquo;ll ask the girls
to our clam-bake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Dalton,&rdquo; went on Dorothy with a
sigh. &ldquo;After all there is no place like home,&rdquo;
and she dropped her blond head on her arms, in
the familiar pose Tavia described as &ldquo;thinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But home was never like this,&rdquo; declared the
other, following up Dorothy&rsquo;s sentiment with her
usual interjection of slang. At the same moment
she made a dart for a tiny bottle of Dorothy&rsquo;s perfume,
which was almost emptied down the front
of Tavia&rsquo;s blue dress, before the owner of the
treasure had time to interfere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s mean!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy.
&ldquo;Aunt Winnie sent me that by mail. It was a
special kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know my weakness for specials&mdash;real
bargains! There!&rdquo; and Tavia caught Dorothy
up in her arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rub it all on your head.
Tresses of sunshine, perfumed with incense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please stop!&rdquo; begged Dorothy. &ldquo;My hair
is all fixed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;fixest&rsquo; now. The superlative you
know. I do hate your hair prim. Never knew a
girl with heavenly hair who did not want to make
a mattress of it. I have wonderfully enhanced
the beauty of your coiffure, mam&rsquo;selle, for which
I ask to be permitted one kiss!&rdquo; and at this the
two girls became so entangled in each other&rsquo;s embrace
that it would have been hard to tell whom
the blond head belonged to, or who might be the
owner of the bronze ringlets.</p>
<p>But Dorothy Dale was the blond, and Octavia
Travers, &ldquo;sported&rdquo; the dark tresses. &ldquo;Sported&rdquo;
we say advisedly, for Tavia loved sport better
than she cared for her dinner, while Dorothy, an
entirely different type of girl, admired the things of
this world that were good and beautiful, true and
reliable; but at the same time she was no prude,
and so enjoyed her friend&rsquo;s sports, whenever the
mischief involved no serious consequences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>That &ldquo;Doro&rdquo; as her chums called Dorothy,
and Tavia could be so unlike, and yet be such
friends, was a matter of surprise to all their acquaintances.
But those who have read of the
young ladies in the previous stories of the series,
&ldquo;Dorothy Dale;&mdash;A Girl of To-Day,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Dorothy Dale at Glenwood School,&rdquo; have had
sufficient introduction to these interesting characters
to understand how natural it was for a lily
(our friend Dorothy) to love and encourage a
frolicsome wild flower (Tavia) to cling to the
cultured stalk, to keep close to the saving influence
of the lily&rsquo;s heart&mdash;so close that no gardener
would dare to tear away that wild flower from the
lily&rsquo;s clasp, without running the risk of cruelly injuring
the more tender plant.</p>
<p>So it was with these two girls. No one could
have destroyed their love and friendship for each
other without so displacing their personalities as
to make the matter one of serious consequences.</p>
<p>Many other girls had coveted Dorothy&rsquo;s love;
some had even tried to obtain it by false stories, or
greatly exaggerated accounts of Tavia&rsquo;s frolics.
But Dorothy loved Tavia, and believed in her, so
all attempts to destroy her faith were futile. And
it was this faith, when the time came, that inspired
Dorothy Dale to keep the Great Secret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Glenwood School was situated amid the mountains
of New England, and the two girls had completed
one term there. On the afternoon when
this story opens they were lounging in their own
particular room, nineteen by number, waiting for
the recreation bell to send its muffled chimes down
the corridor.</p>
<p>They were waiting with unusual impatience, for
the &ldquo;hour of freedom&rdquo; to come, for they expected
visitors in an automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not,&rdquo; Tavia broke in suddenly, without
offering a single excuse for the surprising interjection,
&ldquo;the Fire Bird will break down, and we
won&rsquo;t get our ride after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful speculation,&rdquo; interposed Dorothy,
&ldquo;but not exactly probable. The Fire Bird is an
auto that never breaks down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, never?&rdquo; persisted Tavia, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; declared Dorothy. &ldquo;Of course
all automobiles are subject to turns, but to really
break down&mdash;Aunt Winnie would never allow
her boys to run a machine not entirely reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o-oh!&rdquo; drawled Tavia, in mock surprise.
Then the girls settled down to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>The Fire Bird, was a touring car in which the
girls had enjoyed some noted rides about their
home town of Dalton. Dorothy&rsquo;s aunt, Mrs.
Winthrop White, of North Birchland, owned the
car, and her two sons, Edward and Nathaniel (or
Ned and Nat, to give them the titles they always
went by) good looking young fellows, were usually
in charge of it when their favorite cousin Dorothy,
and her friend Tavia, were the other passengers.</p>
<p>It may as well be stated at this time that Nat
and Tavia were excellent friends, and even on a
ride that had been termed notorious (on account
of the strange experiences that befell the party
while making a tour), Tavia and Nat had managed
to have a good time, and made the best of
their strange adventures.</p>
<p>It was not surprising then that on this afternoon,
while Dorothy and Tavia waited for another
ride in the Fire Bird, their brains should be busy
with speculative thoughts. Tavia was sure Nat
would think she had grown to be a real young
lady, and Dorothy was so anxious to see both her
cousins, that she fell to thinking they might have
outgrown the jolly, big-boy relationship, and
would come to her stiff and stylish young men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>The peal of the recreation bell in the outer hall
suddenly aroused the girls, and, at the same moment
the &ldquo;honk-honk&rdquo; of the Fire Bird&rsquo;s horn
announced the arrival of the long expected boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Tavia, quite unnecessarily,
for Dorothy was already making her
pearl-tinted veil secure over her yellow head; and
while Tavia was wasting her time, looking out of
the window at the auto, which was surrounded by
boys and girls who stood on the path, plainly admiring
the two cousins and the stylish car, Dorothy
was quite ready for the ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come, Tavia!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;The afternoon
is short enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Com&mdash;ing!&rdquo; shouted her irrepressible companion
in high glee, making a lunge for her own
veil, and tossing it over her head as she dashed
down the corridor.</p>
<p>Dorothy stopped at the office on her way out to
tell the principal, Mrs. Pangborn, that the expected
visitors had arrived, and that she and Tavia
were starting for the ride, permission to go having
been granted in advance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Outside, just beyond the arch in the broad driveway,
the Fire Bird panted and puffed, as if anxious
to take flight again. Ned was at the steering
wheel and as for Nat, he was helping Tavia
into the machine &ldquo;with both hands&rdquo; some jealous
onlookers declared afterward. However Dorothy&rsquo;s
friend Rose-Mary Markin (known to her
chums as Cologne because of her euphonious first
names) insisted differently in the argument that
followed the puffing away of the car.</p>
<p>It was no small wonder that the coming of the
Fire Bird should excite such comment among the
girls at Glenwood school. An automobile ride
was no common happening there, for while many
of the parents of the young ladies owned such machines,
Glenwood was far away from home and so
were the autos.</p>
<p>Edna Black, called Ned Ebony, and regarded as
Tavia&rsquo;s most intimate friend, insisted that Tavia
looked like a little brown sparrow, as she flew off,
with the streamers of her brown veil flying like
wings. Molly Richards, nick-named Dick, and
always &ldquo;agin&rsquo; th&rsquo; government&rdquo; like the foreigner
in politics, declared that the girls &ldquo;were not in it&rdquo;
with the boys, for, as she expressed it, &ldquo;girls always
do look like animated rag-bags in an automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys just put themselves on the seat and stay
put,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;but girls&mdash;they seem to
float above the car, and they give me the shivers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; interrupted Cologne, &ldquo;the
damsels manage to hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Dorothy was a picture,&rdquo; ventured Nita
Brant, the girl given to &ldquo;excessive expletive ejaculations,&rdquo;
according to the records of the Nick Association,
the official club of the Juniors.</p>
<p>So the Fire Bird, with its gay little party, flew
over the hills of Glenwood. Dorothy was agreeably
surprised to find her cousins just as good
natured and just as boy-like as they had been
when she had last seen them, and they, in turn,
complimented her on her improved appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look younger though you talk older,&rdquo;
Ned assured Dorothy, with a nice regard for the
feminine feeling relative to age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tavia looks&mdash;looks&mdash;how?&rdquo; stammered
Nat, with a significant look at his elder
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; replied the other evasively, determined
not to be trapped by Nat into any &ldquo;expert
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond words!&rdquo; finished Nat, with a glance
of unstinted admiration at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad as that?&rdquo; mocked Tavia. &ldquo;The girls
do call me &lsquo;red head&rsquo; and &lsquo;brick-top.&rsquo; Yes, even
&lsquo;carroty&rsquo; is thrown at me when I do anything to
make Ned mad. You know that&rsquo;s the girl,&rdquo; she
hurried to add, &ldquo;the girl&mdash;Edna Black&mdash;Ned
Ebony for short, you know. She&rsquo;s the jolliest
crowd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many of her?&rdquo; asked Ned, pretending
to be ignorant of Tavia&rsquo;s school vernacular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legion,&rdquo; was the enthusiastic answer, which
elastic comment settled the question of Edna
Black, for the time being, at least.</p>
<p>The roads through Glenwood wound up and
down like thread on a spool. Scarcely did the
Fire Bird find itself on the top of a hill before it
went scooting down to the bottom. Then another
would loom up and it had to be done all over
again.</p>
<p>This succession of steep grades, first tilting up
and then down, kept Ned busy throwing the
clutches in and out, taking the hills on the low
gear, then slipping into full speed ahead as a little
level place was reached, and again throwing off
the power and drifting down while the brakes
screeched and hummed as if in protest at being
made to work so hard. The two girls, meanwhile,
were busy speculating on what would happen if an
&ldquo;something&rdquo; should give way, or if the powerful
car should suddenly refuse to obey the various
levers, handles, pedals and the maze of things of
which Ned seemed to have perfect command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This reminds me of the Switch-back Railway,&rdquo;
remarked Nat, as the machine suddenly
lurched first up, and then down a rocky &ldquo;bump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-y-y-es!&rdquo; agreed Ned, shouting to be heard
above the pounding of the muffler. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
like a trip on the Scenic Railway&mdash;pretty pictures
and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t dangerous,&rdquo; ventured Dorothy,
who had too vivid a remembrance of the narrow
escape on a previous ride, to enjoy the possibility
of a second adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger at all,&rdquo; Ned hastened to assure
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long hill at last!&rdquo; exclaimed Nat, as the
big strip of brown earth uncoiled before them,
like so many miles of ribbon dropped from the sky,
with a knot somewhere in the clouds. &ldquo;A long
hill for sure. None of your dinky little two-for-a-cent
kinds this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Dorothy, involuntarily catching
at Ned&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Be careful, Ned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned took a firmer grip on the steering wheel,
as he finished throwing out the gear and shutting
off the power, while the spark lever sent out a
shrill sound as he swung it in a segment over the
rachet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The hill was not only remarkably steep, but
consisted of a series of turns and twists. Down
the grade the car plunged in spite of the brakes
that Ned jammed on, with all his force, to prevent
a runaway. He was a little pale, but calm,
and with his steady hands on the wheel, clinging
firmly to it in spite of the way it jerked about, as
if trying to get free, he guided the Fire Bird down,
the big machine swerving from right to left, but
ever following where the lad directed it.</p>
<p>As they swung around a turn in the descending
road a clump of trees obstructed the view for a
moment. Then the car glided beyond them, gathering
speed every moment, in spite of the brakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creek!&rdquo; yelled Tavia in sudden terror,
pointing to where a small, but deep stream flowed
under the road. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the creek and the
bridge is broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was spanned by a frail structure, generally
out of order and in a state of uncertain repair.
It needed but a glance to show that it was
now in course of being mended, for there was a
pile of material near it. Work, however, had
been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Then, there flashed into view a warning signboard
announcing that the old planking of the
bridge had been taken up to allow the putting
down of new, and that the bridge was impassable.
The four horror-stricken occupants of the car saw
this at a glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the car!&rdquo; cried Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered Ned hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the emergency brake on, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to
hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; called Nat. &ldquo;I saw a wagon
go over the bridge when we were on our way to
the school this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it crossed on some loose, narrow planks!&rdquo;
Tavia gasped. &ldquo;I saw them put the boards there
yesterday when we were out for our walk! I forgot
all about them! Oh! Stop the car! We
can&rsquo;t cross on the planks! We&rsquo;ll all be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned leaned forward, pulling with all his
strength on the brake handle, as if to force it a
few more notches back and make the steel band
grip tighter the whirring wheels that were screeching
out a shrill protest at the friction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; he exclaimed almost in a
whisper.</p>
<p>The Fire Bird was dashing along the steep incline.
Ned clung firmly to the steering wheel, for
though there was terrible danger ahead, it was also
close at hand should the auto swerve from the
path. His face was white, and Nat&rsquo;s forced
breathing sounded loud in the ears of the terror-stricken
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>The bridge was but a few hundred feet away.
The auto skidded along as if under power, though
the gasolene was shut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plank across the entrance! Maybe
that will stop us!&rdquo; cried Nat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in this world!&rdquo; replied Ned, in despairing
tones.</p>
<p>Dorothy was sending up wordless prayers, but
she did not stir from her seat, sitting bravely still,
and not giving way to useless terror. Nor did
Tavia, once the first shock was over, for she saw
how quiet Dorothy was, and she too, sank back
among the cushions, waiting for the crash she felt
would soon come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If some boards are only down!&rdquo; murmured
Ned. &ldquo;Maybe I can steer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the Fire Bird had crashed
through the obstruction plank. It splintered it as
if it were a clothes pole, and, a moment later, rumbled
out upon the frail, loose planking, laid length-wise
across the floorless bridge, as a path for the
repair teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; shrieked the two girls in one
breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Nat jumped up from his seat, and, leaning forward,
grasped his brother by the shoulders.</p>
<p>Then what followed was always a mystery to
the four who had an involuntary part in it. The
front wheels took the narrow planks, and clung
there as Ned held the steering circle steady.
There was a little bump as the rear wheels took
the same small boards. There was a crashing,
splintering sound and then, before any of those in
the car had a chance to realize it, the Fire Bird had
whizzed across the bridge and was brought to a
quick stop on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; gasped Ned, as he tried to open the
paralyzed hands that seemed grown fast to the
steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; cried Nat, as he leaped from
the car and pointed back toward the bridge.
&ldquo;We broke two planks in the very middle, and
only the fast rate we clipped over them saved us
from going down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an escape!&rdquo; cried Tavia as she jumped
from her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the car damaged?&rdquo; asked Dorothy, as she
too alighted to stand beside her chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something happened to the radiator when we
hit the rail and broke it,&rdquo; said Ned, as he saw water
escaping from the honey-comb reservoir.
&ldquo;But I guess it won&rsquo;t amount to much. It isn&rsquo;t
leaking badly. The idea of the county having a
picture bridge over a river! Why there&rsquo;s a swift
current here, and it&rsquo;s mighty deep. Just look at
that black whirlpool near the eddy. If we&rsquo;d gone
down there what the machine left of us would have
been nicely cooled off at any rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys were soon busy examining the
car, while Dorothy and Tavia stood in the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy.
&ldquo;I do believe we ought not to go auto riding&mdash;something
happens every time we go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that I knew about the bridge!&rdquo;
whispered Tavia. &ldquo;Only yesterday I saw it and
noticed how unsafe it was. Then I forgot all
about it. Oh, Dorothy! If anything had happened
it would have been my fault!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">TAVIA HAS PLANS</span></h2>
<p>Dorothy threw her arms about Tavia, and,
for a few moments the two girls were locked in
each other&rsquo;s embrace. The reaction, following
their lucky escape from almost certain death, had
unnerved them. Nor were the two boys altogether
free from a shaky feeling, as they carefully
looked over the car to see if it had suffered any
further damage than the leaky radiator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think she&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; asked Nat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; replied his brother. &ldquo;My, but
that was as close a call as I have ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. I guess we&rsquo;d better take a breathing
spell before we go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat down on a grassy bank, and the
girls followed their example. They looked back
over the bridge, and at the two broken planks that
had nearly proved their undoing. Through the
spaces, where the flooring was torn up, the black,
swirling waters could be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>While the auto party are resting until they have
somewhat gotten over the fright caused by their
narrow escape, let me tell something of Dorothy
and her friends. As set forth in the first book of
this series, &ldquo;Dorothy Dale; A Girl of To-Day,&rdquo;
the girl was the daughter of Major Frank Dale, a
veteran of the Civil War. He ran a weekly newspaper,
called <i>The Bugle</i> in Dalton, a small town
in New York state. Dorothy&rsquo;s mother had died
some years previous. The girl had two brothers,
younger than herself, named Joe and Roger.</p>
<p>Dorothy took part in a temperance crusade in
Dalton and had much to do in unraveling the mystery
of an unfortunate man given to drink. He
left a small fortune to his daughter, whose whereabouts
were unknown, and Dorothy succeeded in
finding her. In her work the girl was much hampered
by a man named Anderson, who sought to do
her bodily harm, and who was at the bottom of the
mystery concerning the daughter of the unfortunate
man.</p>
<p>Dorothy proved herself a brave girl, and, with
the help of Tavia, who became her especial chum,
did much to aid several persons in Dalton.</p>
<p>In the second volume, &ldquo;Dorothy Dale at Glenwood
School&rdquo; there I related how Dorothy and
her father came upon better days. Major Dale
fell heir to quite a sum of money, and could give
up the newspaper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Dorothy was sent to Glenwood School, where
Tavia accompanied her. The two girls had many
exciting times there, and Dorothy was suspected of
something for which she was not to blame, suffering
much in consequence of her desire to shield another
girl. There was much fun at the school,
in spite of this, however including a queer walking
match and a strange initiation.</p>
<p>Dorothy and her father moved to North Birchland,
the home of Mrs. Winthrop White, Mr.
Dale&rsquo;s sister. Anderson, the man who had caused
Dorothy so much trouble turned up again, but was
eventually sent to jail.</p>
<p>After the holidays Dorothy and Tavia returned
to school, where we find them at the opening of
this story. They had become friends of nearly
all the students, though, as is natural, had made
some enemies, as what girl does not?</p>
<p>Now the party on the roadside prepared to start
off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive myself for not remembering
about the dangerous state of the bridge,&rdquo; went on
Tavia, when Ned and Nat had announced that
the auto was fit to continue its journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it was,&rdquo; insisted Tavia. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
have forgotten it, Doro, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, to give Dorothy credit, she would not have
been so thoughtless. But she was a different type
of girl from Tavia. It was the way she had been
brought up, as much as her own character, that
caused this difference. Good breeding is not a virtue,
it is a blessing: hence in considering such a
gift we admire the fortunate possessor, just as we
esteem the beauty of the cultured rose, and, naturally
compare it favorably when placed next to some
coarse untrained wild flower.</p>
<p>So it was with our two friends, Dorothy and
Tavia. Dorothy was well bred, and could always
be relied upon, for the good breeding was nicely
coupled with a kindness of heart that composed a
charming character. Though Dorothy had no
mother her aunt, Mrs. Winthrop White almost
filled that place in the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The White family, with whom Dorothy, her
father and two brothers had gone to live, since the
advent of the legacy, consisted of Mrs. White and
her two sons, Nat and Ned. Mr. White had died
some years ago, while engaged in a scientific expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Not having a daughter of her own Dorothy&rsquo;s
Aunt Winnie was especially fond of her pretty
niece, and, as the girl could barely remember her
own mother, she lavished her affection on her father&rsquo;s
sister.</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s affection, love and devotion to her
father was of a different type from that given to
any other living creature, not excepting her own
darling brothers, Joe and Roger, and Roger had
almost grown up in his sister&rsquo;s arms, for he had
been a tiny baby when his mother was called away.</p>
<p>It was in Dalton that Dorothy had met and
learned to love Tavia. The Travers family, of
whom Tavia was the most interesting member,
lived not far from the Dale homestead. Tavia
had grown up with Dorothy, as her most intimate
friend and companion, and it was Dorothy&rsquo;s love
for Tavia that had wrought miracles for the girl
who lacked proper home training, for her parents
were of that class generally designated as improvident.</p>
<p>Tavia always ignored the saving rules of correct
society, and, being naturally bright, and
strangely pretty was, now that she was in her fifteenth
year, in a fair way to be spoiled by those
who delighted to hear her witty nonsense, and who
looked upon her frolics as entertaining in an otherwise
stupid old world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we go along now?&rdquo; asked Ned, as
he again took his place at the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but go slow,&rdquo; begged Tavia. &ldquo;We can
go home by a different road. We have lots of
time, before we have to be back to Glenwood
School for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow it is,&rdquo; replied Ned, not at all sorry that
he could take it easy after the strenuous time.
Dorothy had many questions to ask her cousins&mdash;all
about her father&rsquo;s rheumatism&mdash;whether the
electric treatment was doing him as much good
as the doctors had promised&mdash;how her brothers
were getting on at school&mdash;how strange it seemed
to have Roger at school!&mdash;and scores of other
things. But she always came back to her father
or the boys&mdash;to Roger&mdash;she could scarcely imagine
her baby brother running home to Aunt
Winnie with his book under his arm.</p>
<p>While Ned and Dorothy were thus busy with
family affairs, Nat and Tavia, seated on the rear
seat, were discussing purely personal matters.
Nat told of the tour he and his brother had made
from North Birchland, the trip being undertaken
with other members of a club, which was holding
a meet not far from Glenwood School. Tavia
found plenty of small interesting talk to &ldquo;give and
take&rdquo; with Nat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;do you think
we could get off all day to-morrow and take a run
out to where the auto meet is being held? It
would be all sorts of fun and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; echoed Dorothy. &ldquo;Why you
know we have our English exams. and our geometry
to make up. Besides, Mrs. Pangborn would
never allow us to go to a boys&rsquo; camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow us! Just as if we were in the kindergarten!
Let&rsquo;s make up some excuse and go!
Now, Doro, don&rsquo;t look so shocked! Surely
you have the right to go out with your own cousins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia, don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy severely. &ldquo;You know perfectly well we
are under the school rules, and that we are in honor
bound not to violate them. As if any sensible
girl would risk her good standing for such an escapade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the &lsquo;standing&rsquo; at Glenwood compared
to the &lsquo;sitting&rsquo; in the Fire Bird?&rdquo; asked
Tavia flippantly. &ldquo;Besides, just think of all
the jolly fellows we would meet; wouldn&rsquo;t we,
Nat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great collection of wild ducks out
there at the auto camp,&rdquo; Nat answered rather reluctantly,
for he plainly saw that Tavia&rsquo;s surprising
proposition had caused Dorothy serious annoyance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve a mind to go myself. Will you
come for me, boys? I could disappear at class
hour, when all the &lsquo;tattle-tales&rsquo; will be sure to be
busy, scheming out of their work. Then I could
get back in time to have my head tied up at lunch
hour&mdash;head-ache all the morning, you know.
Simplest thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the boys scarcely smiled as Tavia unfolded
a possible plan to deceive her teachers, and to
dishonor her own name. Her friends were well
accustomed to her pranks and prattle, and usually
regarded her nonsense as mere babble. But,
somehow, Tavia, was &ldquo;growing up,&rdquo; lately, and it
seemed quite time for her to take life more seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia,&rdquo; spoke up Dorothy finally, &ldquo;you came
to Glenwood upon my aunt&rsquo;s recommendation, and
under my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wing!&rdquo; broke in Tavia, throwing her arms
out toward the slender form of the girl seated
ahead of her in the auto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; finished Dorothy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly
sure that my cousins will never take part in any
such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Flea, you&rsquo;ve bitten me, and you must
die!&rdquo; sang Tavia, making a series of melo-dramatic
gestures, that caused the boys to laugh and even
made Dorothy smile in forgiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus are my social ambitions nipped in the
bud&mdash;extinguished in their first, faint gleaming,&rdquo;
went on Tavia, assuming a tone of tragedy.
&ldquo;Well, my fairy-godmother, Dorothy Dale Glenwood,
when that day comes that I am forced to
spurn the lines of the Social Swim, and you find
me beyond the ropes, clinging helplessly to the tail-end
of my former prestige, carried out with the
great, surging tide of struggling humanity, then
you will remember that I had attempted a correct
debut, and it ended in a splash of Dale indignation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Tavia&rsquo;s nonsense had a ring of reality
to-day. Perhaps it was the narrow escape at
the bridge that had tinted her pictures with such
a serious tone&mdash;she seemed preoccupied, and gave
her chatter in words contradicted by her voice and
manner. It was some minutes before any one
spoke. All appeared to be enjoying the &ldquo;valedictory,&rdquo;
and presently Tavia, promising to &ldquo;turn
over a new leaf,&rdquo; made a grab for a branch of a
tree the auto just then passed under, and swished
the foliage she captured until every leaf showed
its silvery under-side against the deep blue sky.
She laughed at her joke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know,&rdquo; said Ned, as he swung
the car into a cross-road that led to Glenwood,
&ldquo;mother expects you to come to North Birchland,
with Dorothy, this summer, Tavia. We&rsquo;ll try to
make you comfortable&mdash;ahem! Nat has a
brand new tandem, besides white duck duds to
burn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy! To wear,&rdquo; corrected his brother.
&ldquo;Mother says white ducks are economical for man&mdash;and
beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll come with me, Tavia,&rdquo; said
Dorothy, noting instantly that her chum had not
responded to the kind invitation that Nat had delivered
for his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Tavia, vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to spend all your time at Dalton?&rdquo;
continued Dorothy, much puzzled at Tavia&rsquo;s
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no indeed,&rdquo; answered Tavia, promptly
this time, showing plainly, that she had other plans
than those connected with her home town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Nat aside, in pardonable
earnestness, for his good times, with the
&ldquo;little bronze beauty&rdquo; of Dalton, were cherished
among his very best memories. Tavia was certainly
a jolly girl, and Nat liked her&mdash;why should
he not&mdash;like her?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be sure to see you,&rdquo; Tavia answered
Nat.</p>
<p>Sure to see him? Yes, but she little dreamed
then how very glad she would be to see him&mdash;and
what serious happenings were to take place before
that meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A CUP OF TEA</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; began Tavia that evening, as the
two girls sat alone in their room, enjoying their
usual good-night conference, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t you
take that spin out to the auto meet. It would be
no end of good fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; echoed Dorothy, surprised that Tavia
should again venture to propose such a thing.
&ldquo;Why, Tavia! Really you shock me!&rdquo; Then
she went to the little dresser, under pretext of looking
for something, but in reality to gain time&mdash;she
scarcely knew what to say to her chum, whose
sudden whim was so startling.</p>
<p>Tavia sat on the box divan, her hands in her
lap, and her brown head bent over, a strange and
serious attitude for the girl who was never known
to sit still, even in church; and who had the reputation
of being the jolliest girl at Glenwood. For
some moments she appeared to be unconscious of
Dorothy&rsquo;s presence, so absorbed was she in her
own thoughts. Dorothy was now regarding her
curiously. What could have turned Tavia&rsquo;s
head? For turned from its usually bright and
happy line of thought it plainly was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tavia?&rdquo; she asked finally, stealing
up to the crouched figure, and placing her arm
gently about her chum&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired the other, with a sudden
start, as if afraid Dorothy would divine her
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are worried about something&mdash;come tell
me what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried!&rdquo; Tavia jumped up, shaking off
Dorothy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Worried! Dorothy Dale, I
believe you&rsquo;re not well! You act morbid&mdash;creepy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy turned away. She was hurt&mdash;crushed&mdash;that
Tavia should spurn her affection and refuse
her confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always told each other everything,&rdquo; and
Dorothy almost sighed, as her words came slowly,
and with strange coldness. &ldquo;I never imagined
you would keep any important secret from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly!&rdquo; exclaimed Tavia, throwing her
arms around Dorothy this time. &ldquo;Who said I
had a secret? What in the world has put that
wild notion into your yellow head?&mdash;bless it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>This last expression brought a kiss to the golden
ringlets, and, as the two girls sat there, Dorothy
with a far-away look in her eyes that were clouded
with unbidden tears, Tavia with her cheek pressed
lovingly against the blond head, and her own eyes
looking into some unknown future, their pose was
like a stage picture&mdash;the kind usually presented
when one sister is about to leave a country home,
and the other bids her stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we a couple of jays!&rdquo; broke in Tavia,
as soon as she appeared to realize the melo-dramatic
effect. &ldquo;I declare we ought to travel as
&lsquo;The Glum Sisters&mdash;Mag and Liz.&rsquo; There!
Wouldn&rsquo;t we make a hit for teary ones? Weeps
are in great demand they say. Smiles are being
overworked in the profresh!&rdquo; and she strode up
to the mirror with a most self-satisfied glance at
her pretty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia, you are getting awfully big for slang&mdash;it
seems more like sneering than joking,&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been wanting to
say that to you&mdash;some of the other girls have
noticed it. They say you act more like a chorus
girl than a Glenwood pupil. Of course I don&rsquo;t
want to hurt your feelings, but I thought it would
be better for me to tell you than for you to hear
it from some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chorus girl! Thanks! No need to apologize,
I assure you. That&rsquo;s from silly, little Nita
Brandt, I suppose? Well, better to act like a
chorus girl than&mdash;a fool!&rdquo; blurted out Tavia
with a show of temper. &ldquo;And any silly girl, who
can not keep things to herself&mdash;well, I always
thought Nita was a featherhead and now I know
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed it was not Nita!&rdquo; Dorothy hastened
to assure her. &ldquo;It was at the lawn tea the
other day. You were &lsquo;acting&rsquo;; don&rsquo;t you remember?
Doing that funny toe dance you are always
trying lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o-o-h!&rdquo; and Tavia made a queer little
pout, and a very funny face. &ldquo;So they appreciated
my maiden effort, eh? I am indeed flattered!
Tell the girls I&rsquo;m much obliged and I&rsquo;ll
see that they get passes for the initial performance.
Tell them, also, to have the bouquets tagged&mdash;it&rsquo;s
so annoying to have a great stack of &lsquo;Please
accepts&rsquo; to answer, with the superscriptions &lsquo;cut
out&rsquo; so to speak. I know all the girls will send
pansies&mdash;they are so sweet, and would make such
wicked faces for the girls who could not conveniently
present their own adorable &lsquo;phizes&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you talking about?&rdquo;
asked Dorothy, who had been listening to the outburst
with a queer idea that all this stage business
was not mere idle chatter&mdash;that there might be
a reason for Tavia&rsquo;s cynicism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about auto rides,&rdquo; quietly answered
Tavia, recovering herself with an effort. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
that a dandy this afternoon? And to think we
might have missed that &lsquo;Horatius at the bridge&rsquo;
business if I had been silly enough to mention that
the planking was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy, shuddering.
&ldquo;I cannot bear to think of what might
have happened. And, Tavia, you must not think
I have adopted the lecture platform for good, but
I must say, it was careless of you not to mention
about the bridge&mdash;especially as you knew what
a hill led down to it, and how the Fire Bird can
cover hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know I entirely forgot it,
Doro,&rdquo; and now Tavia showed some remorse at
the reprimand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! There&rsquo;s the bell!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy
as a clang sounded down the corridor. &ldquo;I
had no idea it was so late,&rdquo; and she jumped up to
disrobe. &ldquo;Quick, or Miss Higley will see our
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her,&rdquo; answered Tavia indifferently. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t feel very well, and would just love something
warm&mdash;say a nice little cup of tea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>A tap at the door interrupted her remarks.
Dorothy jumped into a large closet and Tavia
calmly opened the portal.</p>
<p>It was Miss Higley, the second assistant teacher,
with rather a forbidding expression on her
wrinkled face, and who, among the girls, bore a
reputation characterized as &ldquo;sour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is this?&rdquo; she demanded, stepping in and
brushing Tavia aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking of calling you,&rdquo; answered
Tavia, clapping her hand to her waist line. &ldquo;I
have such a dreadful&mdash;Oh, dear!&rdquo; and she sat
down without further explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need anything?&rdquo; asked Miss Higley,
her tone more kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; certainly not,&rdquo; sighed Tavia. &ldquo;I
would not trouble you. But if I might have a
sip of tea&mdash;that tea you brought Dorothy did her
so much good the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to allow a proper expression of
agony to spread over her face, and gently rubbed
her hand over the region covered by her belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you made that tea yourself,
didn&rsquo;t you? It was so good, Dorothy told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled it. For any one to praise Miss
Higley&rsquo;s brew! So few persons really do appreciate
a good cup of tea. As usual Tavia had
&ldquo;won out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why of course I&rsquo;ll get you a cup. I have
just made a small pot&mdash;I felt rather&mdash;rather
tired myself. I don&rsquo;t, as a rule, drink tea at
night, but I was not altogether well. Where is
Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just slipping on a robe,&rdquo; with a glance at the
closet where her chum was concealed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I disturbed her,&rdquo; went on Tavia glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll get the tea,&rdquo; Miss Higley remarked,
as she started to leave the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring the
pot here and we can take it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; called Tavia to Dorothy as the door
closed. &ldquo;Slip on your robe. Tea with Higley!
Of all the doin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; and she promptly turned a
somersault on the hitherto unrumpled bed.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the girls howl! I do hope she brings
biscuits. There, get down your box, you precious
miser! Just think of &lsquo;crackering&rsquo; Higley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy appeared dumfounded. It had all
been arranged so quickly&mdash;and there was Miss
Higley back again. She carried a tray with a
small china teapot and three blue cups to match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Dorothy might like a cup,&rdquo; she remarked
in a sort of apologetic way. &ldquo;There
now,&rdquo; as Tavia and Dorothy relieved her of the
tray, &ldquo;it will be pleasant to have a sip together.
Of course we would not do it but for Octavia&rsquo;s
illness.&rdquo; (Tavia looked to be in dreadful pain
at that moment.) &ldquo;But since we have to give
her a cup of tea, we may as well make a virtue of
necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you, Miss Higley,&rdquo; Dorothy
said, rather hesitatingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that we&mdash;that
is I&mdash;I mean Tavia&mdash;should not have
put you to all this trouble&mdash;but of course one
can&rsquo;t help being ill,&rdquo; she hastened to add, for she
felt she was rather giving Tavia&rsquo;s secret away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is too bad to make all this fuss,&rdquo; the
supposed sufferer interjected. &ldquo;You went to a
lot of trouble for me, Miss Higley, and I appreciate
it very much,&rdquo; and Tavia winked the eye
next to Dorothy, but concealed the sign from the
sight of the instructress. Tavia was trying hard
not to laugh, and her repressed emotion shook the
tray to the no small danger of upsetting the teapot,
cups and all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never consider my duty any trouble,&rdquo; answered
Miss Higley, seeming to feel the obligation
of being dignified. In fact, it did not occur
to her just then that she was doing a most unprecedented
thing&mdash;taking tea with two school girls,
and after hours at that! However, she had committed
herself, and now there was no way out.
Dorothy presented her package of chocolate
crackers, and Miss Higley took some, while Tavia
arranged the tea tray on the little table.</p>
<p>Surely the scene was mirth-provoking. Dorothy
in her pretty blue robe, Tavia with her hair
loose, collar off and shoes unlaced, and Miss Higley,
prim as ever, in her brown mohair, with the
long black cord on her glasses. There the three
sat, sipping tea and &ldquo;making eyes,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;too full
for utterance,&rdquo; as Tavia would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such lovely tea,&rdquo; Dorothy managed to gulp
out at the risk of allowing her mouth to get loose
in a titter, once the tight line of silence was broken.</p>
<p>Then, all at once they stopped drinking&mdash;some
one was coming down the hall. Miss Higley
arose instantly. The gentle tap on the door
was answered by Tavia.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pangborn!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she apologized, &ldquo;I did not mean to disturb
a little social tea. Do sit down, Honorah,&rdquo;
to Miss Higley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you enjoying
yourself,&rdquo; and Mrs. Pangborn meant what
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, I merely came to administer to a
sick girl. Octavia was suddenly taken with
cramps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Mrs. Pangborn glanced at Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that cup of tea has made me feel so much
better,&rdquo; declared Dorothy&rsquo;s room-mate, with that
kind of truth that mere words make&mdash;the kind
that challenges falsehood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always glad to see you looking after the
girls, Honorah,&rdquo; went on the principal, &ldquo;but I
am equally glad to see you consider yourself. I&rsquo;m
sure you have a perfect right to take a cup of tea
here. My dear,&rdquo; to Dorothy, &ldquo;perhaps you have
a sip left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy found there was another cup of the
beverage, still warm in the little teapot, and this
she poured into her own pink and white china
cup for Mrs. Pangborn.</p>
<p>Miss Higley remained standing, seemingly too
abashed to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do finish yours,&rdquo; said Tavia, pushing the
empty chair toward the embarrassed teacher.</p>
<p>But Tavia&rsquo;s mirth showed through her alleged
illness, and Miss Higley began to feel that she had
been imposed upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&mdash;if you will excuse me,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do finish your tea,&rdquo; begged Mrs. Pangborn,
and so the severe little teacher was obliged
to sit down again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>An hour later Tavia was still trying to &ldquo;untwist
her kinks,&rdquo; as she described her attacks of
muffled laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it gloriotious!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;To think I couldn&rsquo;t get a single twinge in my
entire system! If I only could put that sort of a
cramp in alcohol, wouldn&rsquo;t it be an heirloom to
Glenwood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do stop,&rdquo; pleaded Dorothy, from under
her quilt. &ldquo;The next time they may bring a
doctor and a stomach pump, and if you don&rsquo;t let
me go to sleep I do believe I will call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare to and I&rsquo;ll get something dreadfully
contagious, so you will have to be disinfected and
isolated. But Higley the terrible! The abused
little squinty-eyed tattle-tale! Oh, when Mrs.
Pangborn said she was glad to see her enjoying
herself! That persecuted saint enjoying herself!
Didn&rsquo;t she look the part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even such mirth must succumb to slumber
when the victim is young and impressionable, so,
with yawns and titters, Tavia finally quieted down
to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE APPARITION</span></h2>
<p>It seemed to Dorothy that she had scarcely
closed her eyes when she was startled by someone
moving about the room. She sat up straight to
make sure she was not dreaming, and then she saw
a white object standing before the mirror!</p>
<p>A beam of moonlight glimmered directly across
the glass, and Dorothy could now see that the
figure was Tavia.</p>
<p>Surmising that her companion had merely arisen
to get a throat lozenge, for she had been taking
them lately, Dorothy did not speak, expecting
Tavia to return to her bed directly.</p>
<p>But the girl stood there&mdash;so long and so still
that Dorothy soon called to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Tavia?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; returned the other, without
looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making up,&rdquo; and Dorothy could see her daubing
cold cream over her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Still convinced that Tavia was busy with some
ordinary toilet operation, as she had, of late, become
very particular about such matters, Dorothy
turned over and closed her eyes. But she could
not sleep. Something uncanny seemed to disturb
her every time she appeared to be dropping off
into a doze.</p>
<p>Finally she sat up again. There was Tavia still
before the mirror, daubing something over her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia!&rdquo; called Dorothy sharply. &ldquo;What
in the world are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making up,&rdquo; replied Tavia a second time,
and without moving from her original position.</p>
<p>Making up! Surely she was spreading cold
cream and red crayon dust all over her face! Had
she lost her mind?</p>
<p>For an instant Dorothy stood watching her.
But Tavia neither spoke nor turned her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia!&rdquo; she called, taking hold of the hand
that held the red chalk. Dorothy noticed that
Tavia&rsquo;s palm and fingers were cold and clammy!
And Tavia&rsquo;s eyes were open, though they seemed
sightless. Dorothy was thoroughly frightened
now. Should she call someone? Miss Higley
had charge of that wing of the school, and perhaps
would know what to do. But Dorothy hesitated
to make a scene. Tavia was never ill, and
if this was only some queer spell it would not be
pleasant to have others know about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Then, feeling intuitively, that this &ldquo;making
up&rdquo; should not be made a public affair, Dorothy
determined to get Tavia back into her own bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; she asked, rubbing her own
hand over her companion&rsquo;s greasy forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill? No, indeed,&rdquo; Tavia replied, as mechanically
as she had spoken before. Still she smeared
on the cold cream and red crayon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; commanded Dorothy, and, to her
amazement, the girl immediately laid down the
box of cream and the stick of chalk while Dorothy
led her to the bed and helped her to make herself
comfortable on the pillows.</p>
<p>Then Dorothy quietly went to the dresser and
lighted a tiny candle, carrying it over to Tavia&rsquo;s
bedside.</p>
<p>Peering anxiously into her face she found her
room-mate sleeping and breathing naturally.
There was no evidence of illness, and then, for the
first time, it occurred to Dorothy that Tavia had
been walking in her sleep! And making-up in
her sleep!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>What could it mean?</p>
<p>How ghastly that hideous color and the streaks
made Tavia&rsquo;s face appear!</p>
<p>And, as Dorothy sat beside the bed, gazing
into that besmeared face, while the flicker of the
little candle played like a tiny lime-light over the
girl&rsquo;s cruelly changed features, a strange fear
came into Dorothy&rsquo;s heart!</p>
<p>After all, was Tavia going to disappoint her?
Would she fail just when she seemed to have
turned the most dangerous corner in her short
career&mdash;that of stepping from the freedom of
girlhood into the more dignified realm of young-ladyship?
And would she always be just ordinary
Tavia Travers? Always of contradictory
impulses, was she never to be relied upon&mdash;never
to become a well-bred girl?</p>
<p>Tavia turned slightly and rubbed her hand
across her face. She seemed to breathe heavily,
Dorothy thought, and, as she touched Tavia&rsquo;s
painted cheek she was certain it was feverish.
With that promptness of action that had always
characterized Dorothy&rsquo;s work in real emergencies,
she snatched the cold cream from the dresser
where Tavia had left it, and, with deft fingers,
quickly rubbed a generous supply over the face on
the pillows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Although Tavia was waking now Dorothy was
determined, if possible, to remove all traces of the
red paint before Tavia herself should know that it
had been on her cheeks. Briskly, but with a hand
gentle and calm, Dorothy rubbed the cream off
on her own linen handkerchief, taking the red
mixture with it. Nothing was now left on Tavia&rsquo;s
face but a thin coating of the cold cream.
That could tell no tales.</p>
<p>Tavia turned to Dorothy and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what is the matter?&rdquo; she asked, like
one waking from a strange dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, dear,&rdquo; answered Dorothy. &ldquo;But
I guess you had some night vision,&rdquo; and she placed
the candle, still lighted, on the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I call? Did I have the nightmare?
Why are you not in bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got up to see if you were all right,&rdquo; answered
Dorothy truthfully. &ldquo;Do you want anything?
Shall I get you a nice cool drink from the
ice tank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavia was rubbing her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this on my cheeks?&rdquo; she asked,
bringing down her hand, smeared with cold
cream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were feverish,&rdquo; said Dorothy,
&ldquo;and I put a little cream on your face&mdash;cold
cream might be better than nothing, I thought, as
we had no alcohol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavia did not seem her natural self, and Dorothy,
not slow to note the change in her, was only
waiting to see her companion more fully awake,
and so out of danger of being shocked suddenly,
before calling for help, or, at least, for some medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head aches awfully,&rdquo; said the girl on the
bed. &ldquo;I would like a drink of water&mdash;if&mdash;if
it is not too much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A call bell was just at the door and Dorothy
touched the gong as she went out into the hall to
get the water.</p>
<p>She had scarcely returned with the drink when
Miss Higley, in gown and slippers, entered the
room. The light had been turned on by this
time, and Tavia could see that the teacher was
present, but, whether too sick or too sleepy to
notice, she seemed to take the situation as a matter
of course, and simply drank the water that Dorothy
held to her lips, then sank wearily back on her
pillow.</p>
<p>Miss Higley, without saying a word, picked up
the hand that lay on the coverlet and felt the pulse.
Dorothy stood looking anxiously on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Tavia really seemed sick, and the tinge of
scarlet crayon, that remained after Dorothy&rsquo;s cold
cream wash, added a higher tint to the feverish
flush that now suffused the girl&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has a fever,&rdquo; whispered Miss Higley.
&ldquo;But it is not a very high one. I will go and get
my thermometer. Meanwhile pick up your garments,
Dorothy, so you can take my room, while I
stay here the rest of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Dorothy could answer Miss Higley had
tiptoed noiselessly from the apartment. Dorothy
did not like to leave Tavia&mdash;surely it was not
anything that might be contagious. But when the
teacher returned she insisted on Dorothy going
directly to the room at the end of the hall, while
she took up her post at the bedside of Tavia.</p>
<p>It seemed so hard to Dorothy to leave her
friend there alone with a comparative stranger.
As she reluctantly closed the door on Tavia and
Miss Higley, Dorothy&rsquo;s eyes were filled with
tears. What could be the matter? All the joking
had turned into reality in that short time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>But Tavia was surely not suffering any pain,
thought Dorothy, as she seemed so sleepy and did
not even murmur when Miss Higley gave her the
fever medicine. It flashed across Dorothy&rsquo;s mind
that it might have been better to have acquainted
Miss Higley with the way Tavia&rsquo;s attack came on&mdash;to
tell her of the scene before the mirror&mdash;but
somehow, Dorothy felt that she should not be
told&mdash;that it would be easier for Tavia if her
strange actions were not mentioned to any one&mdash;even
to Tavia herself. Dorothy felt the matter
would not be a pleasant one to discuss.</p>
<p>And as no one knew it but Dorothy, she would
keep it to herself, unless some development in
Tavia&rsquo;s illness would make it necessary to give the
entire history of the case.</p>
<p>With a head almost bursting, it seemed, from
the stress of the complication of worry and anxiety,
Dorothy finally settled down on Miss Higley&rsquo;s
cretonne couch, while the teacher tried to
make herself comfortable in Dorothy&rsquo;s place, and
Tavia Travers lay still and heavy with a fever, all
unconscious of the changes that were going on
about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">AN UNTIMELY LETTER</span></h2>
<p>For three days after that eventful night Tavia
was obliged to keep to her room. She had a fever&mdash;from
a cold the doctor thought&mdash;nothing contagious
he was positive&mdash;but, as a precautionary
measure Dorothy was given another room, until
the fever should be entirely broken.</p>
<p>But the two friends were not to be separated
much longer, for Tavia had quite recovered now,
and was up and about her room, receiving notes
and flowers from the girls, and recuperating generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first good rest I&rsquo;ve had in months,&rdquo; Tavia
told Dorothy, as they sat together again on
the little window seat, looking out on the tennis
court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do really believe you look better than you
did before you were taken ill,&rdquo; agreed Dorothy,
giving her friend a look of unmistakable admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky for me,&rdquo; Tavia replied with
something that sounded like a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dorothy in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; was the answer, given rather
evasively. &ldquo;But a girl can&rsquo;t afford to get
scrawny. Fancy yourself slinking down like a
cornstalk in the fall! Why, even the unapproachable
Dorothy Dale could not well stand the slinking
process, to say nothing of an ordinary gawk
like me going through it,&rdquo; and Tavia slyly looked
into the mirror. She evidently had some particular
reason for being so anxious about her good looks.</p>
<p>Dorothy had been noticing this peculiarity of
Tavia&rsquo;s for some time&mdash;she had been so extreme
about her toilet articles&mdash;using cold cream to
massage her face daily, then brushing her hair
ardently every night, to say nothing of the steam
baths she had been giving her face twice a week.</p>
<p>All this seemed very strange to Dorothy, but
when she laughed at Tavia&rsquo;s new-found pastimes
the latter declared she was going to look nice for
the summer; and that any girl who did not take
care of herself externally was quite as blamable as
she who neglected the hidden beauty of heart or
brain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>And there was no denying that the &ldquo;grooming&rdquo;
added much to the charms of Tavia&rsquo;s personality.
Her hair was now wonderfully glossy,
her cheeks delicately pink, her arms round and her
hands so shapely! All this, applied to a girl who
formerly protested against giving so much as half
an hour daily to her manicure needs!</p>
<p>Dorothy was anxious to have a serious talk with
Tavia, but considered it too soon after her illness
to bring about that conversation, so she only
smiled now as Tavia set all her creams and stuffs
in a row, then stretched herself out &ldquo;perfectly flat
to relax,&rdquo; as the book directions called for. Fancy
Tavia doing a thing like that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I dare&mdash;that is as soon as that old
Rip Van Winkle of a doctor lets me off,&rdquo; said
Tavia suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a set of exercisers
for myself. I don&rsquo;t believe we have half
enough muscle work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, one would imagine you were
training for the circus ring,&rdquo; said Dorothy
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I never was
keen on bouncing, and circus turns all end with a
bounce in the net. Those nets make me creepy&mdash;a
mattress for mine when on the rebound.
Have you been to the post-office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m going. Want any stamps?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. But if&mdash;if you get a letter for me I
wish you wouldn&rsquo;t put it into Mrs. Pangborn&rsquo;s
box&mdash;I expect a little note from a girl, and I&rsquo;m
sure it need not be censored, as the rest of the letters
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rule,&rdquo; Dorothy reminded her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the United States postal laws are of
more importance than the silly, baby rules of Glenwood
school,&rdquo; snapped Tavia with unexpected
hauteur, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s against the law for one person
to open the letters of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Pangborn takes the place of our
mothers&mdash;she is really our guardian when we
enter her school. We agree to the rules before
we are taken in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we were &lsquo;taken in&rsquo; when we agreed to
the rules,&rdquo; persisted the other. &ldquo;Now, as it&rsquo;s
your turn to do the post office this week, I think
you might do me a little favor&mdash;I assure you the
letter I expect is not from some boy. Other girls
can smuggle boys&rsquo; letters in, and yet I can&rsquo;t contrive
to get a perfectly personal note from a perfectly
sensible girl, without the missive being&mdash;passed
upon by&mdash;google-eyed Higley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tavia! And she was so kind to you
when you were sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she? Then she ought to keep it up, and
leave my letters alone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Dorothy rising, &ldquo;I must go for
the mail at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t save my one little letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; Dorothy pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you do get it&mdash;see it among the
others&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you leave it there? I will be
able to walk down to the post office myself tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t get the mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I could,&rdquo; and Tavia tossed her head
about defiantly.</p>
<p>Dorothy was certainly in a dilemma. But she
was almost due at the post-office, and could not
stay longer to argue, so, clapping on her hat, she
bade Tavia good-bye for a short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It palls on me,&rdquo; Tavia told herself, as she
again approached the glass and took up the cold
cream jar. &ldquo;Who would ever believe that I
would stoop so low! To deceive my own darling
Dorothy! And to make a fool of myself with
this &lsquo;mugging&rsquo; as Nat would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped heavily into a chair. The thought
of Dorothy and Nat had a strange power over the
girl&mdash;she seemed ashamed to look at her own
face when the memory of her dearest friends
brought her back again to the old time Tavia&mdash;the
girl free from vanity and true as steel to Dorothy
Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the letter,&rdquo; thought Tavia, recovering
herself. &ldquo;If that letter gets into Mrs. Pangborn&rsquo;s
hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she buried her face in her arms. Something
seemed to sway her, first one way, then the
other. What had caused her to change so in
those last few short months? Why were her
words so hollow now? Her own &ldquo;copyrighted&rdquo;
slang no longer considered funny, even by those
girls most devoted to her originality? And why,
above all else, had she fallen ill after that queer
dream about making-up with the cold cream and
the red crayon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my mind was not built for
secrets,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;and if I keep on
moping this way I can&rsquo;t say what will happen
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dorothy was making her way back
from the village with the letters including one
addressed to Octavia Travers. She had determined
not to make any attempt at giving the note
to Tavia without the school principal&rsquo;s knowledge,
for, somehow she feared Tavia&rsquo;s honesty in such
matters, and, although Dorothy felt certain that
Tavia would do nothing she really believed to be
wrong, she was afraid her chum might be misled
by some outside influence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>With a heavy heart Dorothy laid the mail down
on Mrs. Pangborn&rsquo;s desk. That lady was just
coming into the office as Dorothy was about to
leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pangborn, &ldquo;until I
see if there is any mail for the girls in your corridor.
How is Octavia to-day? I hope she will
be able to go out by Sunday. Here, I guess this
is a letter for her.&rdquo; Dorothy almost turned pale
as the principal took up the small blue envelope.
&ldquo;Just take it to her&mdash;perhaps it will cheer her
up,&rdquo; and she handed Dorothy the missive without
attempting to open it or question the postmark.
&ldquo;There, I guess that is all I can give you,&rdquo; and
she put the others in her desk. &ldquo;Tell Tavia I
am anxious to see her out of doors again, and I
hope her letter will have good news for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy turned away with a smile of thanks,
not venturing to say a word. She held the blue
envelope in her hand, as if it was some tainted
thing, for she well knew that the missive was not
from home, the postmark &ldquo;Rochester&rdquo; standing
out plainly on the stamped corner.</p>
<p>Tavia saw her coming, and quickly caught sight
of the envelope in her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, you old darling!&rdquo; she exclaimed, giving
Dorothy a vigorous hug. &ldquo;I knew you would
bring it to me. How you did ever manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Pangborn sent it with kind wishes that
it might contain good news,&rdquo; stammered Dorothy.
&ldquo;I made no attempt to get it to you without her
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had it? And gave it back to you? Why,
Dorothy, if she had&mdash;but of course it would not
really have mattered,&rdquo; and Tavia slipped the letter
into her blouse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully obliged. Did
you hear from home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dorothy simply, a flush covering
her fair face as she saw Tavia hide the letter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for a few minutes&mdash;so you may
read that very important note, Tavia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">ON THE LAWN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a very small girl,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mollie Richards, otherwise known as Dick, &ldquo;I
used to hope I would die young so I could escape
the tooth-filling process, but here I am, doing these
dreadful exams, and I haven&rsquo;t died yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never despair,&rdquo; quoted Rose-Mary. &ldquo;The
worst is yet to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, fellows,&rdquo; lisped little Nita Brandt,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been promised a clam-bake when it&rsquo;s all
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I fancy it will be all over with me when
that clam-bake arrives,&rdquo; sighed Edna Black.
&ldquo;Since Tavia has &lsquo;turned turtle&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t even
have the fun of sneezing for exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill wind&mdash;and so on,&rdquo; ventured Dick.
&ldquo;That was a most abominable habit of yours&mdash;sneezing
when you were too lazy to open your
mouth to laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never would have believed that Tavia
would get so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Batty,&rdquo; finished Amy Brooks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang,
but I know of no English word into which the explicit
&lsquo;batty&rsquo; may be translated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tavia of all girls,&rdquo; added Ned, ponderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems to agree with her,&rdquo; declared
Cologne. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you noticed her petal complexion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much like the drug store variety,&rdquo; objected
Nita. &ldquo;I like something more substantial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sour grapes,&rdquo; fired back Ned, who could always
be depended on to take Tavia&rsquo;s part.
&ldquo;Yours is so perfect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;freckles,&rdquo; admitted the confused
Nita with a pout. &ldquo;Fair skins always
freckle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you close the &lsquo;fair&rsquo; and raffle
off,&rdquo; suggested Dick. &ldquo;Much easier than
sleeping in lemon juice every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly Richards, you&rsquo;re too smart!&rdquo; snapped
the abused one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether so,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;At
least this abominable French can&rsquo;t prove it. I
have always believed that the only way to acquire
a good French accent would be to get acute tonsilitis.
Then one might choke out the gutterals
beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The girls of Glenwood school were supposed
to be busy preparing for examinations. They
had congregated in little knots, out of doors, scattering
under the leafing oaks, and the temptation
to gossip was evidently more than mere girls could
withstand amid such surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dorothy now,&rdquo; announced Cologne,
as the latter turned into the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there&rsquo;s Tavia,&rdquo; followed Ned, showing
keen pleasure as the late absent one made her
appearance on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will have a chance to study her complex&mdash;&rdquo;
lisped Nita with rather a malicious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit you better to study your complex&mdash;verbs,&rdquo;
snapped Ned, while Tavia and Dorothy
came up at that moment.</p>
<p>Profuse greetings were showered upon Tavia,
for the girls were well pleased to have her back
with them, and it must be admitted that every eye
which turned toward her came back in an unanimous
vote &ldquo;beautiful.&rdquo; Even Nita did not dare
cast a dissenting glance&mdash;she could not, for indeed
Tavia had improved wonderfully, as we have
seen, under the &ldquo;grooming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Her hazel eyes shown brighter than ever in her
clear peach-blow skin, her hair was not now &ldquo;too
near red&rdquo; as Nita had been in the habit of declaring,
but a true chestnut brown, and as
&ldquo;glossy as her new tan shoes,&rdquo; whispered Ned
to Cologne.</p>
<p>Tavia wore her brown gingham dress, and
much to the surprise of her companions, had &ldquo;her
neck turned in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to your collar?&rdquo; asked Dick,
with a merry twinkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to it,&rdquo; answered Tavia promptly.
&ldquo;No sense in having one&rsquo;s neck all marked up
from collars&mdash;going about advertising capital
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the new woman! We will make her
president of our peace conference. But of course
we would not expect her to settle her own &lsquo;squabs&rsquo;
with Nita. We will have a committee of subs,
for that department of the work,&rdquo; said Cologne
as she made room for Dorothy at her side, being
anxious to get a private word with her. Tavia
found a place between Ned and Dick, and soon
the others were at least pretending to be at their
books, realizing that too much time had already
been wasted on outside matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>The morning typified one of those rare days
in June, and the girls on the lawn were like human
spring blossoms&mdash;indeed what is more beautiful
than a wholesome, happy young girl?</p>
<p>She need not be especially beautiful in feature,
for health and happiness make her irresistible to
the real student of beauty, and the wonderful
charm of human life seems nowhere to be so perfectly
depicted as in the personality of a young
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; announced Lena Berg, rolling over
as the bell for recreation sounded, ending the
period of open-air study usually allowed at this
season.</p>
<p>Instantly the others were on their feet, and, as
quickly had paired off for their favorite pastime.
Ned and Tavia were together, Dorothy was with
Cologne, and the others had selected their companions
to suit their particular fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Parson,&rdquo; began Cologne, using the name
made for Dorothy from her initials &ldquo;D. D.,&rdquo; and
placing her arm about Dorothy&rsquo;s waist, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got a great scheme on. We&rsquo;re going swimming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swimming!&rdquo; Dorothy almost screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that,&rdquo; insisted Cologne. &ldquo;Mrs.
Pangborn has given the permission and we are to
go to Squinty Lake to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Squinty Lake?&rdquo; echoed Dorothy in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they call it Sunset, you know, but Ned
declares it is &lsquo;Squinty&rsquo; as no one can look out of
the front of her eyes on the shores of it. But isn&rsquo;t
it too giddy&mdash;to go swimming so early. And to
think that Higley is the best swimmer of the respected
faculty. Now if our dear little Camille
Crane were here&mdash;Feathers, you know. But I
don&rsquo;t suppose she will be back to the bench this
season. Wasn&rsquo;t it too bad she should break
down?&rdquo; rattled on Cologne. &ldquo;But for the
swimming! Aren&rsquo;t you perfectly delighted?
You haven&rsquo;t said a single word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I haven&rsquo;t had a chance,&rdquo; replied Dorothy
laughing. &ldquo;Of course it is lovely to think
you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go! Aren&rsquo;t you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so. Tavia is so fond of swimming,
and I am sure she would not dare go in the
water so soon after her fever. So I guess I&rsquo;ll stay
home to keep her company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly!&rdquo; exclaimed Cologne. &ldquo;Why
should you stay out on her account?&rdquo; and, possibly
there was a note of jealousy in the girl&rsquo;s tone,
and a hint of it in her manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sure
she wouldn&rsquo;t do as much for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed she would, Cologne,&rdquo; Dorothy hurried
to say. &ldquo;You have no idea how kind Tavia
can be and has been to me. Why, when I was
sick home in Dalton, she stayed with me night and
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t go in
bathing when you get a chance. Precious seldom
the chance comes at Glenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Pangborn has hired the
beach,&rdquo; ventured Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, worse luck. Afraid any one would see
our orphan asylum bathing suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I think those brown suits very pretty,&rdquo;
objected Dorothy. &ldquo;I thought so when I saw
them taken out this spring. Of course I have
never worn one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Cologne.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you like &rsquo;em, but you should try to
swim dog fashion in one of those knickerbockers.
The skirts are built for hoops, but they seemed to
run short of goods on the bloomers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is awfully good of Mrs. Pangborn to
provide for bathing when we will soon be at our
own summer quarters for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I admitted that much at the start, if you
will remember. But, really, Doro, you had better
make up your mind to go in. It&rsquo;s all nonsense to
stay out to keep Tavia company. I&rsquo;m sure she
would rather see you in the swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; answered Dorothy, as they turned
back into the path that led to the Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">AT SUNSET LAKE</span></h2>
<p>The day following proved to be one of those
exceptionally warm days that occasionally come at
the end of June, with the express purpose, it
would seem, of making life unbearable for those
engaged in finishing up a term at school. All the
morning the Glenwood pupils lived on the
thoughts of the promised swim, to come that afternoon.
When dismissal hour did finally drag
around little attention was paid to luncheon, all
minds and hearts being set on the jaunt to Sunset
Lake. This was a summer resort not far from
the school, and there was a good sandy stretch for
bathing. The season had hardly opened yet, and
Mrs. Pangborn was thus able to hire for that
afternoon the exclusive right of the sandy shore
for her pupils.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Tavia were to go, although
neither expected to take the lake bath, for Dorothy
was firm in her resolve to stay with Tavia,
and so forego one of her favorite pastimes, for
Dorothy Dale was counted an excellent swimmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>In high glee the party started off, under the
chaperonage of Miss Higley, and even those pupils
who insisted that she was &ldquo;a bear&rdquo; were
forced to admit that, on this occasion, she was &ldquo;as
meek as a lamb.&rdquo; The fact was that Miss Higley
loved swimming, and knew she was expert at
the exercise. So the promised sport was especially
welcome to her.</p>
<p>Along the shady road to the lake Dorothy
laughed and chatted as merrily as did the others,
but Tavia was inclined to pout. She had begged
to be allowed to go into the water, declaring that
she was entirely recovered and that the swim
would do her good. But Mrs. Pangborn would
not consent, so Tavia was to take what enjoyment
she could derive from watching the others.</p>
<p>When the Glenwood girls reached Sunset Beach
the entrance gate to the bathing grounds was
locked against all outsiders. A row of bathing
houses was placed at the disposal of the young
ladies, and there was a matron in attendance. In
fact, the pleasure grounds were turned over entirely
to Mrs. Pangborn&rsquo;s pupils and the presence
of the white-aproned attendant gave the place a
look of the utmost propriety. On this occasion,
likewise, the life guard was banished, and, as Dick
expressed it, &ldquo;there never was a man in sight
when the girls in brown took their annual.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>While the others were &ldquo;making themselves
frog-like&rdquo; in the aforementioned suits, Dorothy
and Tavia established themselves in an old boat
on the shore of the lake.</p>
<p>It was their first visit to the resort as it was
their first summer term at Glenwood, and the
two girls were charmed with the pretty, picturesque
surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much like our pond in Dalton,&rdquo; Tavia
observed, viewing the placid lake with its great
open expanse of sunlit waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but that was a splendid little pond for
swimming,&rdquo; Dorothy reminded her companion,
never relishing any aspersions thrown in the direction
of &ldquo;dear old Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon some of the girls appeared on the little
boardwalk bordering the lake, and, in unheard of
politeness, waited for Miss Higley to come out
and take the first plunge. That formality being
over there was a wild rush for the water, each one
of the girls expecting to have a better time than
any of the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Nita Brandt and Adele Thomas had not yet
learned to swim, so these two were provided with
a pair of water-wings to support them, and they
&ldquo;floundered around like a couple of ferry boats,&rdquo;
Tavia declared, as they made all sorts of vain attempts
to strike out like the others.</p>
<p>Dick and Cologne were soon engaged in a race,
from one float to the other, doing the overhand
stroke, and making a fine showing for the first of
the season efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exceeding the speed limit!&rdquo; shouted
Tavia from the boat, as she stood up in the stern
and viewed the race with unconcealed interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo; called a dozen voices
as the twain with their water-wings anchored
directly in Dick&rsquo;s course.</p>
<p>But the girls floating on the wings could not get
upon their feet for they were in water about up
to their heads. Every effort they made to touch
bottom seemed to send their faces down, while
simultaneously two pair of stockings would shoot
up above the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>Miss Higley instantly realized that Nita and
Adele were out too far&mdash;that they were beyond
their depth and therefore in danger should the
wings (which were muslin bags blown up) burst
or slip from under their arms. She did not wait
to see the result of the race, but struck out for the
now thoroughly frightened girls, who were calling
in vain for some one to help them to shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As Miss Higley reached them, Dick and Cologne,
who had not grasped the situation, came
gliding up to the same spot, almost side by side,
working earnestly, each to outdistance the other in
reaching the float which was the goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; shouted Miss Higley to them.
&ldquo;Stop! Never mind the race! Help get these
two girls in. They&rsquo;re exhausted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two swimmers veered around to Nita and
Adele. Yes, Nita was gasping! She had evidently
swallowed considerable water. And Adele
could not attempt another stroke&mdash;her limbs
seemed paralyzed.</p>
<p>Without speaking, thinking to save her breath
for the struggle, Cologne took a position between
the badly frightened girls, while Miss Higley and
Dick swung around so that each could grasp an
arm, one of Nita and the other of Adele. In this
manner the three swimmers towed to shore those
who had ventured too far on the water-wings.</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was plenty of excitement
at Sunset Beach, everyone gathering around
the rescued ones, suggesting both restoratives and
punishments to close the incident.</p>
<p>Miss Higley quietly waited for the girls to recover
their breaths and other faculties that had
been temporarily suspended during the mishap,
and then asked why they had ventured out so far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; gulped Nita. &ldquo;We just stayed
perfectly still and we kept going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; finished Miss Higley, &ldquo;you must not
again get on those wings without some one at hand
to help you, or until you can manage them better.
I&rsquo;m thankful nothing worse happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Nita and Adele, much chagrined and more
disappointed, were obliged to spend the remainder
of their swimming time with Dorothy and Tavia
on the beach, as wading did not suit them after
their attempt at swimming, unsuccessful as it had
proven.</p>
<p>As the afternoon waned the interest in the water
exercise grew keener, and those who could trust
themselves were indulging in all sorts of &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo;
sliding down an inclined wooden chute, and diving
from a spring board. Miss Higley posted herself
near the danger line, realizing that she must act
as guard and look out for the safety of the swimmers.</p>
<p>Presently some one suggested an endurance trial,
and this attracted almost all the girls away from
the chute over toward the stretch of deep water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>But Edna Black did not join the racers. She
had never before tried &ldquo;shooting the chutes&rdquo; and
was infatuated with the sport. Time after time
she climbed the little ladder and as quickly slid
down the curved, inclined plank into the water
again. Dorothy and Tavia were watching her
from the shore, calling to her in merry nonsense
and joking about her sliding propensities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going down!&rdquo; called Tavia as Edna took one
more slide.</p>
<p>They waited&mdash;but she did not come up!</p>
<p>Miss Higley, too, was watching for the young
diver&rsquo;s re-appearance.</p>
<p>Ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;she counted, but Edna did
not come up. Then, from the very top of the
slide, where she had taken her position some time
before to better watch all the girls, Miss Higley
dove into the water after Edna, cleaving the fifteen
feet of distance from the surface like a flash.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Tavia stood breathless&mdash;watching
for either Miss Higley or Edna to come to
the top.</p>
<p>It seemed ages&mdash;yes, it was too long to stay
under water. What had happened to Miss Higley?
Where was Edna?</p>
<p>An instant later, Dorothy and Tavia&mdash;without
exchanging a word&mdash;kicked off their slippers and
were in the water! There was no time to call to
the girls farther out. Not a swimmer was near
enough to offer help!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Their light summer clothing seemed to make
little difference to these two country girls, who had
learned to swim in Dalton pond, and, in a few
seconds, both had reached the spot where Edna
and the teacher had disappeared.</p>
<p>Tavia was the first to dive, and, in a few seconds
she came up with Edna, white and unconscious,
in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold her&mdash;while I try&mdash;for Miss Higley!&rdquo;
cried Dorothy, as Tavia, supporting her
burden on one arm and grasped the cross bar of
the chute with her other and yelled for help.</p>
<p>Dorothy was now under water, groping for the
other lost one. But she had to come up for air
without bringing Miss Higley.</p>
<p>Down she went again, taking a long breath and
determining to remain under until she could get a
grip on the clothing of the teacher. Now the
others were close at hand to assist Tavia in caring
for Edna. Down and down Dorothy went, the
water gurgling in her ears&mdash;down and down into
the depths.</p>
<p>It seemed as if she could not stand the strain
and pressure. A trail of bubbles and a swirl of
the surface of the lake marked where she had disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Rose-Mary and Dick were the first to reach
Tavia, and they at once took charge of the unconscious
one, floating her to shore between them.
Then others came up to the chute, white, frightened
and trembling at the news Tavia gasped out to
them. So alarmed were they that none of them
dared venture to help Dorothy down there in the
blackness and silence, at her grewsome task.</p>
<p>Tavia, as soon as she had recovered her breath,
had started off to assist Dick and Rose-Mary in
bringing Edna to shore, as the task was no light
one for the three swimmers. Then, as she got into
shallow water Tavia turned, suddenly remembering
something, and shouted to the girls about
the chute:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for Dorothy! She is under there, looking
for Miss Higley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as one or two of the braver girls, feeling
the need of action, prepared to dive, they saw the
pale face of Dorothy Dale come to the surface,
and they saw that, in her arms, she held clasped
the form of Miss Higley. But the hand that
Dorothy stretched out to grasp the bottom of the
chute, that she might support herself and the inert
burden, just failed to catch hold of the wooden
brace, and, amid a swirl of waters Dorothy went
down again, out of sight, with the unconscious
teacher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A LIVELY AFTERNOON</span></h2>
<p>There followed an eternity of suspense for
those watching for the reappearance of Dorothy.
The missing of the hold she expected to get on the
board and the effort to keep Miss Higley up, together
with the struggle she had gone through,
caused the girl to lose all control of herself. She
had sunk instantly without having any opportunity
of using her free arm to keep herself above
water.</p>
<p>Seeing this Rose-Mary and Molly, who had
climbed out on the base of the chute, jumped into
the lake again, making for the spot where they saw
Dorothy go down the second time.</p>
<p>But before they could reach it they saw Dorothy&rsquo;s
head above the surface. She had come up
under the chute, in an open square of water,
formed by the four supporting posts of the affair.
Cautiously she reached out and caught hold of
a beam. Then another arm was seen to grasp a
projecting plank! Miss Higley was struggling!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>She was not dead! Not unconscious!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; screamed Tavia from shore, as
she saw the form of her chum come to the surface
the second time. But Tavia did not see Dorothy
wave a reassuring hand at her as she climbed up
on the chute, and helped Miss Higley support
herself across one of the base planks. For Tavia
had fallen unconscious beside Edna, who was only
just beginning to show signs of life under the
prompt administrations of Rose-Mary and Dick.</p>
<p>In all this confusion the white-aproned matron
forgot to use her telephone. But, as she now
assisted the other girls in working over Edna, she
directed some of the swimmers, who had come to
shore, to look after Tavia.</p>
<p>Lena Berg, the quietest girl of Glenwood, rushed
into the bathing office and telephoned to Central
to &ldquo;send doctors.&rdquo; Almost before those
working over Edna and Tavia had realized it, and,
almost as soon as the throng of young ladies had
started to assist Miss Higley and Dorothy to shore,
an automobile with two doctors in it stopped at
the gate. The physicians were soon working over
Tavia and Edna.</p>
<p>A few seconds later Rose-Mary and Molly
pulled up to shore in an old boat they had found
anchored near the chute, and in the craft, which
they rowed with a broken canoe paddle, were
Dorothy and Miss Higley!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>As so often happens that one small accident is
responsible for any number of mishaps, especially
where girls or women become panic-stricken, it
seemed now that the rescue of Miss Higley and
Dorothy acted like magic to restore all four victims
of the water to their senses, at least, if not to
actual vigor. Tavia and Edna both jumped up as
the boat grounded on the beach, and Miss Higley
and Dorothy staggered ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; cautioned one of the physicians,
as the teacher was seen to totter, and almost fall.
She was plainly very weak, and, while the younger
doctor looked after Dorothy the other, who was
his father, took Miss Higley into the bathing pavilion
office to administer to her there.</p>
<p>Tavia had only fainted. Indeed she had been
scarcely able to swim out to help Edna, not being
entirely recovered from her recent nervous fever.
Edna had swallowed considerable water, but it was
fresh, and when she had been relieved of it, and
the usual restoratives applied, she, too, was herself
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Dorothy insisted there was absolutely nothing
the matter with her, but it was plain that such
physical efforts as she had been obliged to make
in her rescue of Miss Higley, must at least exhaust
a girl of her frail physique. So young
Dr. Morton insisted on her being assisted in a
&ldquo;thorough rub.&rdquo; Then she was given a warm,
stimulating drink, and, soon after that, Dorothy
was able to tell what had happened.</p>
<p>An hour later all the brown bathing suits had
been discarded, Tavia and Dorothy had been supplied
with dry clothing, and all the Glenwood
girls who had come to Sunset Lake sat on the rocky
shore back of the sand, waiting for the hour to arrive
when they must start back to the school.
There was no lack of talk to make the time pass
quickly.</p>
<p>Miss Higley seemed the least perturbed of any&mdash;she
had a way of always being beyond a mere
personal feeling. She never &ldquo;allowed herself&rdquo;
to encourage pains or aches; in fact she was one of
those strong-minded women who believe that all
the troubles of this life are hatched in the human
brain, and, therefore the proper cure for all ills
is the eradication of the germ producer&mdash;sick-thoughts.
So, as soon as she felt her lungs in
working order again she &ldquo;took the defensive&rdquo; as
Tavia expressed it, and sat up as &ldquo;straight as a
whip,&rdquo; with her glasses at exactly the proper pitch
and the black cord at precisely the accustomed
dangle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mar-vel-ous!&rdquo; gasped Dick, aside, giving
the long word an inimitable roll, and, at the same
time, bestowing a wondering look on the recently
resuscitated teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do tell us,&rdquo; begged Rose-Mary, &ldquo;what
happened first&mdash;of all those exciting things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Edna Black. &ldquo;I was shooting
the chute to my heart&rsquo;s content, when, all of a
sudden, I stuck somewhere. Then, after trying
everything I knew how to do to get loose, I said
my prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next,&rdquo; called Rose-Mary, indicating Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; began Tavia, &ldquo;Dorothy and
I were not to go near the water, but when we saw
Edna turn up missing we just kicked off our slippers
and, in the language of the poets, &lsquo;got busy.&rsquo;
I found Ned here, first shot, stuck in between the
two corner boards of the chute posts. She didn&rsquo;t
need any coaxing to come up, once I untangled her
skirt from a nail which held it fast, and I brought
her up without any unnecessary explanations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, in the meantime Miss Higley had gone
down,&rdquo; interjected Dorothy. &ldquo;That is she went
down after Edna first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And came up last,&rdquo; added the teacher, with a
significant nod to Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find Miss Higley, Parson?&rdquo;
Rose-Mary continued to question, with a view to
getting the entire story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found her in a mud hole, held fast, but able
to help herself somewhat. Then I&mdash;I got her
up&mdash;somehow&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I was almost unconscious until you
dragged my head up to the air,&rdquo; Miss Higley
hastened to say, anxious to give Dorothy her due,
for certainly the rescue was a matter of heroic effort,
and Miss Higley, being heavy, and, at the
same time, unable to help herself, gave Dorothy
the most difficult of all the surprising tasks of that
eventful afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when she sank that time&mdash;like a stone,&rdquo;
suggested Dick to Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I merely missed catching hold of a plank
and I had to go down&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t keep up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; why not?&rdquo; put in Nita Brandt,
glad to be able to say something &ldquo;safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Lispy,&rdquo; said Lena to Nita. &ldquo;You
and Adele started the epidemic with your water
wings. Next time make it life preservers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The girlish spirits, &ldquo;bottled up&rdquo; during the
period of worry came out with a resounding
&ldquo;pop&rdquo; now, and the walk home proved even
pleasanter than the one to the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; declared Ned, between her jokes,
&ldquo;we are like the man who laughed at the ugly cow
from inside the fence&mdash;he found it much funnier
to laugh at the cow from outside the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">DOROTHY AND TAVIA</span></h2>
<p>For more than a week after the happenings at
Sunset Lake the pupils of Glenwood School had
little time for anything outside of the regular program
of the institution. It was a matter of sleep,
eat, exercise, then study and recite, and then the
same schedule was begun all over again the following
day. But this was the end of the term
and so much remained to be done that it was necessary
to &ldquo;keep going&rdquo; as the girls expressed it, so
that the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; would find the records of the
year&rsquo;s work up to the usual high standard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mental house-cleaning is perfectly terriblocious!&rdquo;
declared Tavia one morning, showing
her aptitude at coining alleged new words, this
one being a &ldquo;contraction&rdquo; of terrible and ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how nice it will be when we are all done,&rdquo;
Dorothy reminded her, taking up her books and
papers, to attend the last exercise in mathematics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; sighed Tavia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>The conversation was ended abruptly by the
sound of the bell summoning the girls to class, and
they went back to the &ldquo;house-cleaning,&rdquo; each doing
her best to finish honorably, in spite of the difference
of their respective motives.</p>
<p>That evening Dorothy and Tavia went to their
room early. Tavia seemed tired, and Dorothy
did not wish to disturb her by coming in later.</p>
<p>Neither appeared inclined to talk, and, as Tavia
went through her elaborate toilet preparations
(the facial massage and all the accompaniments)
Dorothy watched her in silence.</p>
<p>Strange as it was to believe Tavia so vain, Dorothy
had become accustomed to this nightly process,
and now accepted it without comment. Neither
had she ever told Tavia of that night when, in
her sleep, she had gone through the making-up
process.</p>
<p>But school would soon be over&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>
<p>For some time Dorothy had been putting off a
talk she desired to have with Tavia&mdash;a talk about
their vacation plans. Somehow she dreaded to
undertake the topic that Tavia had been so obviously
avoiding. But to-night Dorothy felt that
she must have an understanding&mdash;she must know
where her room-mate intended to spend her vacation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Dorothy was just about to broach the subject
when Tavia suddenly turned to her with this surprising
question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy, do you think I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course you are,&rdquo; stammered Dorothy.
&ldquo;You know I have always thought you&mdash;pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not mean what you always
thought, Doro. I am awfully serious now. Am
I really pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;I could
not tell what others might think&mdash;but I have always
thought you the prettiest kind of a girl&mdash;you
know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think that in&mdash;in a crowd I might
be considered&mdash;attractive? Are my features
good? Do I look&mdash;look interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with such apparent simplicity that
Dorothy almost laughed. There stood a pretty
girl&mdash;without question a remarkably pretty girl&mdash;of
a most unusual type&mdash;and she was begging
for a compliment&mdash;no, for an opinion of her personality!</p>
<p>Dorothy did not answer. She could not possibly
say that at that moment Tavia was a perfect
vision, as she stood in her white robe, with her
freshly-brushed hair framing the outline of her
sweet, young face. But the girl before the mirror
wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy, do tell me,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;What
do you think? Am I pretty, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia,&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy suddenly, &ldquo;tell
<i>me</i>, why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; and Tavia laughed a little to gain
time, &ldquo;I think any girl ought to know just&mdash;what
she is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this&mdash;this fussing. Why do you do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To experiment,&rdquo; and Tavia laughed lightly.
&ldquo;They say one can do wonders with a little care.
I am tired of reading that in the magazines so I
thought I would just try it.&rdquo; She had finished
with the glycerine and rose water now, so the
&ldquo;stuffs&rdquo; were put away and Tavia sank down
with a &ldquo;glad-of-it&rdquo; sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; began Dorothy, breaking into the
topic of summer vacation, &ldquo;you will go home first,
before you come to North Birchland. You will
want to see everybody in Dalton&mdash;I wish I could
go along with you. But I have no home in Dalton
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; suggested Tavia. &ldquo;We
have plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only romancing. Of course I
should like to see everybody in dear old Dalton,
but I have to go to daddy and the boys. Isn&rsquo;t it
splendid to have a vacation? It makes school
worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Tavia, vaguely, preparing to
turn out the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think you will come to North
Birchland?&rdquo; asked Dorothy directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. I expect to visit Grace Barnum
in Buffalo. Her folks are old friends of mother&rsquo;s.
I had a letter from her yesterday, especially
inviting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you?&rdquo; and Dorothy looked surprised.
&ldquo;I did not hear you speak of going to Buffalo. I
thought you intended to come to Birchland as soon
as you had seen your folks. You know Aunt Winnie
expects you. And so do the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get to the Birches some time during
the summer I guess,&rdquo; Tavia hurried to say, as she
noted Dorothy&rsquo;s disappointment. &ldquo;You can depend
upon it I expect to have some of the fine
times&mdash;you are not to have a monopoly of the
good things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are going to Dalton first, then to
Buffalo, and what time do you count on getting to
Birchland?&rdquo; persisted Dorothy, determined to
know, if possible, just what Tavia&rsquo;s plans really
were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; and Tavia indulged in a discordant
yawn, &ldquo;do let&rsquo;s go to sleep. I&rsquo;m almost
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tavia, you always make some excuse
when I ask you about vacation,&rdquo; and Dorothy&rsquo;s
tone was in no way drowsy&mdash;she certainly was
not sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you always ask such unreasonable questions,&rdquo;
retorted Tavia. &ldquo;Just as if I can tell
what may happen between now and&mdash;midsummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy with a sob. &ldquo;I
feel just as if something dreadful was going to
happen. I don&rsquo;t know why but you&mdash;you have&mdash;changed
so,&rdquo; and the girl buried her head in
her pillow and cried as if something &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo;
had really happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doro, dear,&rdquo; and Tavia clasped the weeping
girl in her arms, &ldquo;what can be the matter? What
have I done? You know I love you better than
anyone in the whole world, and now you accuse me
of changing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you have changed,&rdquo; insisted Dorothy, sobbing
bitterly. &ldquo;Everybody is talking about it.
And if you knew what a time I have had trying&mdash;trying
to stand up for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To stand up for me!&rdquo; repeated Tavia.
&ldquo;What have I done that need provoke comment?
Surely it is my own business if I do not choose to
be the school monkey any longer. Let some of
the others turn in and serve on the giggling committee.
I think I have done my share!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; and Dorothy jabbed her
handkerchief into her eyes, &ldquo;but you are so&mdash;so
different. You always seem to be thinking of
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something else!&rdquo; and Tavia tried to laugh.
&ldquo;Surely it is no crime to be&mdash;thoughtful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it is perfectly dreadful for a girl
to go and grow straight up&mdash;without any warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an old lady I must be,&rdquo; and Tavia
looked very severe and dignified. &ldquo;But, Doro
dear, you need not worry. You surely believe I
would never do anything I really thought wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. You would not think it wrong,
but suppose you did something that turned out to
be wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavia made no answer but the &ldquo;old lady&rdquo; look
came back into her face&mdash;that serious expression
so new to her. She seemed to be looking far
ahead&mdash;far away&mdash;at some uncertain, remote
possibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>For several minutes neither girl spoke. They
could hear the &ldquo;miscreants&rdquo; who had been out
after hours creeping past their door. Every one
in Glenwood should be asleep. The last hall light
had just been turned out&mdash;but the girls from Dalton
were still thinking.</p>
<p>Dorothy, usually the one to mend matters, to-night
seemed sullen and resolute. Plainly Tavia
was hiding something from her, and while Dorothy
could bear with any amount of mistakes or impulsive
little wrongdoings, she could not put up
with a deliberate slight&mdash;a premeditated act of
deception.</p>
<p>Tavia saw that she was bound to hold out&mdash;to
insist upon a &ldquo;clearing up,&rdquo; and, as this did not
suit her, for reasons best known to herself, she attempted
to pet Dorothy back to her usual forgiving
mood.</p>
<p>But the storm that had been so long brewing
was in no hurry to blow over, and Dorothy went
to bed with swollen eyes and an aching head, while
Tavia only pretended to sleep&mdash;she had an important
letter to write&mdash;an answer to the one that
had come in on the evening mail, and required to
be replied to by return of post. This meant that
the missive must be penned that night and dropped
in the post-office the very first thing in the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little Dorothy,&rdquo; Tavia murmured as she
looked down on the fair face, to make sure that
the eyes were resting in sleep, &ldquo;I will never do
anything to disgrace <i>you</i>. Only have a little patience
and you will understand it all. But I must&mdash;must&mdash;&rdquo;
and then she broke off with a long,
long sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">LEAVING GLENWOOD</span></h2>
<p>But one more day remained of the school term
at Glenwood. All the tests had been concluded,
and, as there were to be no formal exercises the
&ldquo;last day&rdquo; was given over entirely to packing up,
and making ready for the departure from the institution.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Tavia were busy with the others.
To Dorothy the prospect of seeing her dear ones
so soon, filled every thought of this day&rsquo;s work.
Tavia, too, seemed more like her old self and &ldquo;jollied
the girls&rdquo; as she flung things into her trunk
with her usual disregard for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all have to come out again,&rdquo; she replied
to Dorothy&rsquo;s remonstrance, &ldquo;so what&rsquo;s the
use of being particular how they go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your pretty Christmas bag,&rdquo; begged
Dorothy. &ldquo;Do be careful not to crush that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed there&rsquo;s nothing to crush. I took
the ribbons out of it for the neck and sleeves of
my white lawn, and when I extracted them from
the flowered stuff there was nothing left but a perfectly
flat piece of cretonne, with a row of little
brass rings on one side. I just ran a bit of faded
ribbon through the rings&mdash;and just wait until I
show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Tavia plunged her hands down into the
depths of her trunk and presently brought up the
article in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, clapping the bag on
her head. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a pretty sunbonnet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy beheld it in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does look sweet on you,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but what in the world will you want a fancy
sunbonnet for? Surely you will not use it in Dalton&mdash;and
in Buffalo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would make a tremendous hit in Buffalo,&rdquo;
declared Tavia, wheeling around to show
off the effect of her thick brown hair beneath the
little row of brass rings that held the ribbon which
bound the bit of flowered stuff to her neck. At
the front her face seemed to fit exactly, and surely
nothing could be more becoming than that
Christmas bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; faltered Dorothy,
&ldquo;to spoil that beautiful bag to make a plaything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we all have to have &lsquo;playthings,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Tavia, with a strong accent on the word &ldquo;play.&rdquo;
Then, with one more swing around, like a figure
in a show case, Tavia took off the sunbonnet and
went on with her packing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so queer,&rdquo; Dorothy remarked, sliding
her tennis racquet down the side of her trunk,
&ldquo;that we should be going in different directions.
We have always been able to help each other in
the packing before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d just like to leave half my old truck
behind,&rdquo; replied Tavia, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know but
what I will have to if this trunk won&rsquo;t stretch a
little. It&rsquo;s chock full now, and just look at the
commotion on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; insisted Dorothy, &ldquo;that you
would have to put the things in differently. Now
you will have to take them all out again and roll
them up tight. You can get twice as much in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them all out!&rdquo; Tavia almost shrieked.
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; And, following this exclamation the
girl jumped into the trunk and proceeded to dance
the &ldquo;trunk traveler&rsquo;s jig&rdquo; on the unfortunate
collection of baggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Dorothy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I heard something break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was my last summer&rsquo;s hat breaking
up its plans for this year. I put it in the bottom
in hopes that it would meet an untimely end, but
I really did not intend to murder it,&rdquo; she joked,
stepping out of the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at any rate,&rdquo; she went on, as she flung
part of the &ldquo;commotion&rdquo; off the floor into the hollow
she had succeeded in making for the various
articles, &ldquo;the poor old thing will take up less room
dead than alive, and there will be no possible
danger of my having to wear it for a turn or two
when I get home. Nothing like getting in one&rsquo;s
supplies while you&rsquo;re fresh&mdash;before the folks
have a chance to get too friendly with you. I&rsquo;ve
found that out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a real pretty hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, even pretty hats are not immune from
accidents, and you saw yourself that it was an accident&mdash;pure
and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later all the trunks had been packed,
and the two Dalton girls sat in their little room
exchanging confidences and making all sorts of
school-girl promises of writing often, and sending
pretty cards, besides having photographs taken of
which to make especially affectionate remembrances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you one just as soon as I get to Buffalo,&rdquo;
Tavia declared, holding Dorothy very close,
for the latter seemed much inclined to cry as the
hour of parting drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be so lonely in North Birchland
without you,&rdquo; persisted Dorothy, with a sob. &ldquo;I
do wish you would give up that trip to Buffalo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavia assured her chum that it would be impossible
as she had promised Grace Barnum to go to
her home to visit her.</p>
<p>Dorothy finally jumped up and made an effort to
pull herself together. She went over to the dresser
and picked up a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo; she began, and then stopped
suddenly. It was a gust of wind that had blown
up the thin strip of muslin covering the top of the
dresser and revealed the little red book. It had
been concealed there and, as Dorothy took it up
she saw on the cover:</p>
<p class="center">HOW TO ACT
<br /><i>The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide.</i></p>
<p>Tavia was at the other end of the room and did
not at once see the book in Dorothy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;do you&mdash;want&mdash;this?&rdquo; Dorothy
stammered, again holding the volume out toward
Tavia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>A deep flush instantly came over Tavia&rsquo;s face.
Dorothy was watching her with a look&mdash;a look
at once pleading and full of sadness.</p>
<p>Tavia put out her hand for the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that funny little leaflet,&rdquo; she tried to say
as if it were a joke. &ldquo;I suppose I might just as
well take it, but it&rsquo;s full of the worst sort of nonsense.
Let me show you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; replied Dorothy, rather
stiffly. &ldquo;But that seems a queer sort of a book
to take home from boarding school. Hadn&rsquo;t you
better destroy it, as you say it is all nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red covers of the pamphlet fluttered in Tavia&rsquo;s
hand. The flush on her cheeks threatened to
match the hue of the book and told its own guilty
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I might as well take it with me,&rdquo; and Tavia&rsquo;s
words sounded rather a lame excuse. &ldquo;It
will be amusing to read on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tavia!&rdquo; Dorothy burst into tears.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give up&mdash;those stage notions? Do,
please!&rdquo; and she clasped her arms about her chum,
weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Dorothy don&rsquo;t cry so!&rdquo; begged
Tavia, stroking the yellow head. &ldquo;I will give it
up&mdash;all up! Yes, Dorothy, dear, listen! Look
here!&rdquo; and at that Dorothy raised her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>With her hands free Tavia tore the little red
book into shreds and tossed them into the waste
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through with&mdash;through
with all of it! I don&rsquo;t want to know
how to act! I&rsquo;ll never try! Dorothy! Dorothy!&rdquo;
and the miserable girl threw herself upon
the bed in a frenzy of grief and excitement.
&ldquo;Just forgive me for it all&mdash;for trying to deceive
you. I have been wretched all through it&mdash;and
I only want you&mdash;and all the others&mdash;just as
you used to be. I don&rsquo;t believe in ambition!&rdquo;
She stood upright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go home to dear, old
Dalton, and stay there until&mdash;until I come to you
at North Birchland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the other girls tapped on the door of
room nineteen late that afternoon, to say good-bye,
they found two very happy young maidens
waiting for the particular carriage that was to take
them to the depot. Dorothy and Tavia could not
be separated. They clung to each other in spite
of all the invitations to &ldquo;do the rounds&rdquo; and join
in the last and noisiest fun of the season. Together,
very demurely, they called at the office to
say good-bye to the teachers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>When, at last, the carriage did come for them,
Dorothy and Tavia rode off together&mdash;one bound
for the train to North Birchland, and the other
going home&mdash;home to Dalton, to try to be happy
in the little country town where she and Dorothy
Dale had spent such a happy childhood, and where
Tavia would find plenty of time to dream of things
scattered far out in another world, that seemed
like the golden fingers of ambition beckoning her
on. To leave Dalton and the common school
life&mdash;to enter the walks of city uncertainties&mdash;to
become part of the great, grinding machine of human
hardships&mdash;that machine which is always
willing to stop its terrific speed long enough to
gather into its cogs and meshes the life of an innocent
young girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A JOLLY HOME-COMING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My! What great big boys! You can&rsquo;t possibly
be my little baby brother Roger. And Joe!
Why he is like a real young gentleman in his tennis
suit!&rdquo; And Dorothy kissed her brothers over
and over again, as they rode from the depot in the
pony cart to the home of Aunt Winnie, &ldquo;The
Cedars,&rdquo; at North Birchland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; drawled Joe, in his good-natured
way. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t complain. You&rsquo;ve
been doing some growing on your own account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have got awfully pretty,&rdquo; lisped
Roger, as he &ldquo;snuggled&rdquo; up closer to his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are just as perfectly handsome
as any big lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, you little flatterbox!&rdquo; and Dorothy gave
him an oldtime squeeze. &ldquo;You have learned
more than your A, B, Cs. at kindergarten. I received
all your letters but could not answer the last
two as we had such an awful lot of writing to do
at the close when examinations came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you pass?&rdquo; asked the younger brother,
by way of showing his understanding of the scholastic
season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I guess Tavia and I did about as
well as the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Tavia come?&rdquo; went on Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is coming, later. You know she had to
go home to Dalton first. Oh, how lovely The
Cedars look! And there is daddy on the porch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy could scarcely remain in the cart as it
rumbled along the shady drive that led to the
broad veranda of Mrs. White&rsquo;s handsome summer
residence. Major Dale was waiting to greet his
daughter, and Aunt Winnie came down the steps
as the cart drove up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she big!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger, as the major
folded Dorothy close in his arms in a most affectionate
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. White, pressing
upon Dorothy&rsquo;s cheek a kiss of welcome. &ldquo;You
<i>have</i> grown!&rdquo; and the glance that accompanied
this simple remark spoke in more than words Mrs.
White&rsquo;s admiration for her pretty niece, and told
Dorothy at once, that her Aunt Winnie was entirely
satisfied with the particular lines that &ldquo;her
growth&rdquo; had taken on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You all look so well, and I am so glad to be
home again at last,&rdquo; said Dorothy as soon as she
had a chance to express her opinion. &ldquo;It is perfectly
fine here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come the boys!&rdquo; called Joe, who was
just turning around on the long drive, preparatory
to taking the cart to the stables, and presently Nat
and Ned came bouncing up the steps.</p>
<p>Before Dorothy had a chance to protest both
cousins were kissing her at once&mdash;Nat declaring
he hadn&rsquo;t kissed a girl since he left Dorothy after
the automobile ride at Glenwood, and the while
Ned was insisting that his &ldquo;little brother&rdquo; should
await his turn and allow the head of the house the
rights of his lawful inheritance.</p>
<p>Such jolly big boys as were Ned and Nat always
have a way of making things both lively and
interesting, especially when a pretty girl cousin is
&ldquo;up for entertaining&rdquo; and, for the remainder of
the afternoon, they entirely monopolized Dorothy,
while Joe and Roger looked on, satisfied to hear
their sister&rsquo;s voice again. As for the major, he
sat there perfectly content to see all his children
about him once more, although it was a trifle odd
to find Dorothy so grown up&mdash;almost a young
lady. And it was so short a time ago that she
would &ldquo;climb all over him&rdquo; when a little homecoming
occurred. How she would fuss with his
hair, and complain that no one had attended to his
brushes or kept his neck-ties pressed during her
absence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But children must grow up,&rdquo; said the major
with a sigh, &ldquo;and Dorothy is a fine girl&mdash;a Dale&mdash;every
inch of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Dorothy was indeed growing to be very
handsome was a matter that Mrs. White contemplated
with pardonable pride. Dorothy was now
her especial charge; she would enter society under
her safe chaperonage. Of course she would first
finish her education; and the aunt hoped that her
niece would not decide to take the higher branches,
inasmuch as this would keep her longer separated
from her relatives. There is plenty of time Mrs.
White decided to learn in our own little world
without spending precious time buried in colleges,
forming ideas that are sure to conflict with the regular
home life, and perhaps, depriving one&rsquo;s family
of the most precious years of a girl&rsquo;s career&mdash;the
time between morning and noon in the life of
mortals.</p>
<p>That evening, while Dorothy was dressing for
dinner, her aunt mentioned the matter to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dorothy dear,&rdquo; she said as she
watched the girl arrange her beautiful hair, &ldquo;it is
all very well to take a college course if you think
you would not be satisfied to live in the home-world
always. But your brothers are growing up, and a
sister&rsquo;s influence is of so much account to growing
lads. I hope you will be satisfied to stay home
with us, after you have finished at Glenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very lonely away from you all,&rdquo;
answered Dorothy, &ldquo;and, as you say, it is not likely
I will ever want to take up a profession.
Therefore I can best finish my education along the
lines I will be required to be most proficient in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own Dorothy,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>It was a merry party that sat down to the bountifully
supplied table. Major Dale was, of course,
at the head, and Mrs. White occupied the seat of
honor at the other end, while Dorothy and Ned,
then Nat and Joe, with Roger next his father,
made up the family party.</p>
<p>Roger insisted on knowing just what Dorothy
usually had for dinner at Glenwood, and upon
learning how extremely simple the school menu
was he decided at once he would never go to boarding
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;s Tavia coming?&rdquo; asked Nat, endeavoring
to hide his particular interest in that question
by trying, prematurely to swallow an unusually
large mouthful of food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She promised to come in a few weeks,&rdquo; answered
Dorothy. &ldquo;She expects to visit Buffalo
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffalo?&rdquo; repeated Nat, vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any objections?&rdquo; asked Ned pointedly, to
tease his younger brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Nat, lamely, &ldquo;Buffalo is a
big city and Tavia is&mdash;is&mdash;merely a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark only made matters worse for Nat,
as the others joined in the &ldquo;jollying&rdquo; and he was
obliged to admit that he did miss Tavia, and was
very sorry she had decided not to visit Birchland
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, little brother,&rdquo; declared
Ned. &ldquo;Tavia certainly is a winner, and when it
comes to an all-round jolly, good-natured&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;um&mdash;help
me out, Dorothy! Any new adjectives
at Glenwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try &lsquo;dandy,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, great!&rdquo; put in little Roger, to whom
&lsquo;dandy&rsquo; always meant something great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks! Thanks!&rdquo; acknowledged Ned. &ldquo;I
think if Lady Tavia stands for all of that she surely
will be well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she can stand for more than that,&rdquo; insisted
her champion. &ldquo;She once confided to me
that she &lsquo;stood&rsquo; for a colored baby. It was christened
in the Dalton canal I believe, and no one, in
the crowd of spectators, had the nerve to stand
for the little one but Tavia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And did she give him his name?&rdquo; asked
Roger, all at once interested in the black baby in
the canal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did for a fact,&rdquo; Nat replied. &ldquo;Yes, Tavia
called that coon Moses, and, if you don&rsquo;t believe
it she still has an active interest in the modern
human frog; let me tell you she sent him a goat
cart on his last birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned significantly. &ldquo;So
that was the goat cart you bought down at Tim&rsquo;s,
eh? Now, I call that real romantic! Mother,
you must include Mosey when next you invite folks
from Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Aunty, please do,&rdquo; begged Roger,
clapping his hands. &ldquo;I just love little colored
boys. They talk so funny and warble their eyes
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Warble,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Nat. &ldquo;Why not
&lsquo;scramble&rsquo;? Scrambled eyes would look real
pretty, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted Roger, &ldquo;I watched a coon
boy look that way one day and the&mdash;yolk of his
eye stuck away up behind the&mdash;the cover. Yes
it did&mdash;really,&rdquo; for the others were laughing at
him. &ldquo;And I told him it was a good thing that
the looker didn&rsquo;t rub off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Everyone agreed with Roger that it was a very
good thing that &ldquo;lookers&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t rub off, and so
the small talk drifted from &ldquo;Mose&rdquo; to more substantial
topics.</p>
<p>Directly after dinner Dorothy went to the library
to sing and play for the major. She had, of
course, improved considerably in her music, and
when the usual favorites were given, including
some war songs, besides &ldquo;Two Little Boys in
Blue&rdquo; for Roger&rsquo;s special benefit, the boys kept
her busy the remainder of the evening playing
college songs, one after the other, for, as fast as
they discovered they did not know one they would
&ldquo;make a try&rdquo; at the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they miss Tavia,&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
White in an aside to the major. &ldquo;She is a genius
at funny songs. What she doesn&rsquo;t know she has a
faculty for guessing at with splendid results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed. It&rsquo;s a pity she didn&rsquo;t come along
with Dorothy. They have always been inseparable,
and I rather miss the little imp myself tonight,&rdquo;
admitted the major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>But when the singers came to the old classics,
&ldquo;Seeing Nellie Home&rdquo; Ned cut &ldquo;Nellie&rdquo; out
and substituted Tavia&rsquo;s name whereat Nat insisted
that he could not stand any more of the &ldquo;obsequies,&rdquo;
and so broke up the performance with a
heart-rending and ear-splitting discordant yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll feel better after that, old boy,&rdquo;
remarked Ned. &ldquo;It must be something awful to
have a thing like that in your system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nat was not altogether joking. In fact he
had more reason than was apparent for wishing
Tavia was with the little party. Tavia had written
one or two letters to Nat&mdash;just friendly notes
of course&mdash;but the tone of them caused the youth
to think that Tavia Travers when with Dorothy
Dale was one girl, and Tavia Travers with others&mdash;the
Buffalo people for example&mdash;might be
quite a different person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like an hour glass,&rdquo; thought Nat, as he
stood on the side porch and tried to laugh at himself
for being &ldquo;spoony.&rdquo; Then he went on:
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s full of &lsquo;sand&rsquo; all right, but too easily influenced.
Now with Dorothy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that Nat turned suddenly and went to
join the others in the library. It was nonsense for
him to worry about a girl&mdash;probably she would
not thank him for his trouble, could she know that
he had the audacity to question her conduct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>But, in spite of this, thoughts of Tavia persisted
in thrusting themselves upon him. After all, sincerity
of purpose is a power that, once aroused, is
not easily cast aside. It is, without question, one
of the greatest factors for good in all this big and
complicated system of endeavor&mdash;in reality the
tie that binds.</p>
<p>So that Nat had taken Tavia&rsquo;s affairs &ldquo;to
heart&rdquo; as he admitted to himself, when thinking
the entire matter over very late that night, and,
from that time on, whether he willed or not, it
seemed to him that these affairs of Tavia&rsquo;s had a
queer way of &ldquo;following him up,&rdquo; although he
little realized that this was the price he would be
called upon to pay for his sincerity of purpose&mdash;the
live factor that exists in spite of all obstacles of
indifference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">DOROTHY IS WORRIED</span></h2>
<p>Dorothy had been at the Cedars one short, delightful
week when again the question of Tavia
and her plans came up for serious consideration.
Mrs. White and her niece sat out on the veranda,
with the early summer flowers perfuming the soft
zephyrs that came through the vine-covered lattice,
and they were talking of the absent one&mdash;wondering
why she did not come to Birchland and instead
went to the city in the summer&mdash;to Buffalo when
everybody in the place (except the tourists on the
way to Niagara to the Falls), were leaving for
more quiet and recreative surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Mrs. White finally, &ldquo;that
Tavia is &lsquo;stage-struck.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words came to Dorothy like a blow&mdash;something
long dreaded but materialized at last&mdash;in
spite of hopes and promises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Winnie!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy with
a sigh, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really think Tavia would do
anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, that I do not, my dear,&rdquo; promptly answered
Mrs. White. &ldquo;A thing is not wrong unless
we intend to make it so. But Tavia has a
queer idea of right and wrong. You know she
has had no home discipline&mdash;no training in character
building. She has grown to be as good as
she is through the commonest law of nature&mdash;she
was born good. But she has not gone beyond that
same law in growing better than she started out
to be&mdash;that is moral development, and requires
careful culture and prudent discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the stage,&rdquo; whispered Dorothy, as if
afraid the very word would breathe contamination.
&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;Tavia would&mdash;would ever try
to&mdash;to go on a public stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that point I could not now express an opinion,&rdquo;
answered the aunt kindly, noticing how seriously
Dorothy had taken her words. &ldquo;Of course
if she happened to get in with persons interested in
that line of work&mdash;she might be tempted to try
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could she do? There are no plays
now&mdash;it is summer time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very time, my dear, when small companies
try to get a hearing. There are no good plays
to attract persons, and the stay-at-homes need some
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>This had not occurred to Dorothy before. Her
dread of Tavia going on the stage had been kept
within bounds by the thought that there were no
plays given in any of the theatres, for Dorothy
knew little about such things, and had never given
a thought to those small companies&mdash;the &ldquo;barnstormers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she announced with a sigh, &ldquo;I believe I
will have to write to her. I can not rest and not
know just where she is. Somehow I feel as if my
own sister had deserted me&mdash;as if she were out
among strangers. Oh, Aunt Winnie, you can not
realize how much Tavia has always been to me!&rdquo;
and Dorothy dropped her head in her hands to
hide the expression of sincere grief that marked her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, child, there is absolutely no need to worry.
No doubt Tavia is snugly home at this moment,
with her own, little, old-fashioned mother&mdash;or
even out in Buffalo enjoying the visit to her
mother&rsquo;s friends. To sit down and imagine all
sorts of horrible things&mdash;why, Dorothy, it is very
unlike you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am silly,&rdquo; Dorothy agreed, smiling
brightly as she looked up, &ldquo;but you know Tavia
has been so odd lately. And then she was sick,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Dorothy looked off across the lawn, but she
seemed to see nothing. Perhaps she had a day-vision
of her friend far away, but whatever Dorothy
imagined was far from what Tavia was actually
engaged in at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come, my dear,&rdquo; said her aunt at
length. &ldquo;The boys are waiting with the auto.
See what a spin through the country will do for
tired nerves. I tell you this winding up of school
is always trying&mdash;more so than you can imagine.
You are, after all, pretty well tired out, in spite
of your pretty pink cheeks,&rdquo; and she tilted Dorothy&rsquo;s
chin up to reach her own lips, just as Nat
swung himself up on the porch and demanded the
immediate presence of his aunt, and cousin, in the
Fire Bird that panted at the door.</p>
<p>But, somehow, the afternoon was all lost on
Dorothy. Those words &ldquo;stage-struck&rdquo; echoed
in her ears and she longed to get back to her room
and write to Tavia and then to receive the answer
that she might show it to Aunt Winnie, to prove
that Tavia was as reliable as ever&mdash;that she
would soon be with them all at North Birchland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>When, after a spin, that on any other occasion
would have been delightful, Ned alighted at the
little village post-office, Dorothy asked him to
bring her out two special delivery stamps. Her
cousin inquired what the rush of mail was for, but
she only smiled and tried to hide the fact that she
really had occasion to provide for sending a letter
in a hurry, and receiving its reply as fast as Uncle
Sam could bring it.</p>
<p>They started off again, and a long, exhilarating
spin brought them out upon the direct road to the
Cedars. Then, after helping their mother and
Dorothy out, the boys &ldquo;shooed&rdquo; the Fire Bird
back to its &ldquo;nest,&rdquo; and made a dash to witness the
last inning of a ball game that had been in progress
all the afternoon on the grounds, just across the
broad meadow, that stretched in front of their
home.</p>
<p>This left Dorothy to herself, for the major had
finally listened to Roger&rsquo;s earnest appeal to take
him to the ball game. Joe went with the boys
who carried the bats&mdash;as the latter was always
sure to be on time. Then, as Mrs. White would
be busy for some time, giving orders for dinner,
Dorothy hurried to her room, and sat down, to
think it all out, before she undertook to put into
written words what she wanted to say to Tavia.</p>
<p>As Dorothy had said to her aunt the loss of
Tavia&rsquo;s companionship was like missing that of a
dear sister, for the two girls had been inseparable
since early childhood. They had always been together,
or they knew they would be apart but for
a few days at most.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>But now it was different. Heretofore each
time that Dorothy thought she would have to be
obliged to leave Tavia, either to attend school, or
take some new step in life, it so happened that
Tavia went along, so that the chain of companionship
that began at Dalton had not yet been
broken.</p>
<p>And, of course, Dorothy&rsquo;s worries might all be
unfounded. As Mrs. White had said, Tavia
might be safe at home with her mother.</p>
<p>So it was to Dalton that Dorothy addressed her
letter. She needed to be particular in wording it,
so that no misunderstanding would arise, should
the letter fall into other hands than Tavia&rsquo;s.
Dorothy enclosed a special delivery stamp for a
hurried answer, which she begged Tavia to send,
and she put another of the stamps on the envelope
of her own missive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said with a sigh of relief as she
slipped the little cream-colored square into her
blouse. &ldquo;I shall just have time to run to the
office with it before dinner. Somehow I feel better
already. It almost seems as if I had been
talking to Tavia. I will surely have an answer
by to-morrow night. I do wonder&mdash;Oh, I wonder
where Tavia is&mdash;and what she is doing just
now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>It was a pleasant walk to the country post-office,
and Dorothy hurried along in a happier frame of
mind than she had enjoyed during all that day.
The small worry that had been smouldering in her
heart for some weeks (ever since the night of
Tavia&rsquo;s queer actions in her sleep when she
painted her face with the red crayon) did not
need much encouragement to burst forth into a
live flame.</p>
<p>And that was precisely what happened when
Nat also expressed the opinion that Tavia should
have come to North Birchland and that Buffalo
was &ldquo;a big place for such a small girl.&rdquo; Then,
that Dorothy&rsquo;s aunt should state plainly her fear
regarding Tavia&rsquo;s love for the stage,&mdash;surely all
this was enough to throw Dorothy into a very
fever of anxiety.</p>
<p>That Dorothy knew of Tavia&rsquo;s strange actions
on that one occasion, and that she alone, was
aware of this, added to the anxiety. The book
&ldquo;How to Act&rdquo; had betrayed Tavia&rsquo;s secret in
clearer terms than even Dorothy would admit to
herself. But if Tavia should run away! And
if Dorothy had not warned the Travers folks in
time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>That evening, after mailing her letter, Dorothy
made an excuse to leave the rest of the family and
so remained in her own room. She wanted to be
alone&mdash;to think. In fact, she had been so accustomed
to those little solitary thinking spells in
Glenwood that the time at the Cedars seemed to
be a trifle too exacting. The boys wanted to be
with their sister, and Mrs. White had so much to
talk over (it was so delightful to have a &ldquo;big
daughter&rdquo; to converse with), then the major
needed Dorothy&rsquo;s counsel in many small, but important
matters, so that, altogether, the girl from
Glenwood found herself busy&mdash;just a little too
busy, considering the problem she was trying to
solve, which was how to get immediately into communication
with Tavia.</p>
<p>That night she dreamed of it all, and for three
days following the mailing of her letter she could
scarcely think of anything other then why the expected
answer did not arrive.</p>
<p>Finally, Dorothy felt that she must take some
one into her confidence. All the nervous energy
of her young nature had, for days, been so set
upon that one point&mdash;to hear from Tavia&mdash;that
the whole circumstance had assumed great
importance. She could think of nothing else.
Every hour added to her anxiety. She imagined
all sorts of dreadful things. Yes, she must tell
somebody of it and thus relieve her mind or she
felt she would be ill. This seemed to her the
greatest trouble she had ever encountered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>It was a delightful summer evening when Dorothy,
dressed in her sea-foam mulle gown, with its
dainty silver white trimmings stepped out on the
porch, and had the good fortune to find Nat there
alone. It was to her young cousin that she had
made up her mind to confide her worries, and here
he was, as if he was just waiting to help her in this
matter of her own heart and Tavia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! But you startled me!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nat, jumping up from the hammock.
&ldquo;I do believe, Doro, that I had clean forgotten
that you were with us&mdash;no offense&mdash;but you see
I was sort of dreaming and when you glided
through that window&mdash;well&mdash;I say, Doro, I
thought my dream had come true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat, could you come for a little walk?&rdquo;
asked Dorothy. &ldquo;You should not dream so
early, and besides, you should not, at any time,
dream of young girls. You admitted as much,
you know. But Nat, I just want a quiet talk&mdash;come
out along the road as far as the bridge. I
want to make sure we are entirely alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you don&rsquo;t expect me to move the bridge,
do you, Doro? We may be all alone with the
exception of the old stone walls and the planks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tucking Dorothy&rsquo;s arm under his own, Nat led
the way down the path, then out upon the open
road, which was now streaked with faint beams of
moonlight, that filtered down through the trees.
Nat seemed to feel that Dorothy wanted to talk
of Tavia, for he had not been slow to notice the
growing look of anxiety that had come upon his
cousin&rsquo;s face in the last few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard from Tavia?&rdquo; he asked in a matter-of-fact
way, thinking to help Dorothy on with her
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Nat,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and that is just
what I want to talk about. I am almost worried
to death about her. Whatever do you think it
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what what means? That Tavia has
not answered a letter? Why that doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything&mdash;at least it didn&rsquo;t last winter, when she
would write me for something she wanted me to
get for her, and forget to write again saying she
had received it. I suppose all girls think they
should take their time writing to a fellow, but
Tavia was about the limit. So you have no reason
to fret, as she will probably write to you the
day she packs her trunk to come to the Cedars.
Then she won&rsquo;t have time to mail the letter, so,
when she gets here, and steams off the uncancelled
stamp, she will calmly hand over the note. Now
that&rsquo;s Tavia and her way of being prompt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this is different,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;I did
not know Tavia wrote to you last winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t go to romancing. I believe I did
get two letters from Miss Travers in answer to
five I had written to her. It was about that little
colored boy you heard me joking about&mdash;some
imp Tavia had taken a fancy to, and she wanted to
get him a small express wagon. So she wrote to
me, being aware of my unusual ability in the line
of selecting suitable express wagons for little colored
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen, Nat,&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly,
&ldquo;I wrote to Dalton a week ago to-day, sent a
special delivery stamp for a quick reply, and I
haven&rsquo;t heard a word since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it. You sent a special stamp.
That was where you made a big mistake. Miss
Tavia wanted to write to that girl in Buffalo&mdash;had
been putting it off as usual&mdash;and when she
saw your blue stamp it brought her the inspiration.
She wrote to &lsquo;Dolly,&rsquo; if Dolly is her name,
used your stamp, and &lsquo;Dolly&rsquo; answered &lsquo;come.&rsquo;
Tavia went. There you are. Now what do you
think of me as a wireless sleuth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think Tavia is in Buffalo?&rdquo;
asked Dorothy, endeavoring to bring her cousin
down to a common-sense viewpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure of it. But, say, Doro. I&rsquo;ll tell you
what! I&rsquo;ll just take a fly in the Fire Bird to-morrow
morning, and find out for you for sure. That
will be better than the special delivery boy on his
bicycle that never moves. I&rsquo;ll be back by lunch
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be splendid!&rdquo; cried Dorothy,
giving her cousin&rsquo;s arm a tight squeeze. &ldquo;You
see I could not trust another letter, and I&rsquo;m
so anxious to know. Oh, Nat, you are the very
best cousin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; interrupted Nat, &ldquo;when it
comes to special messengers. But, little cousin,
you can depend on me. I won&rsquo;t let any one hold
up the automobile mail coach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">LITTLE URANIA</span></h2>
<p>The soft moonlight was now peeping through
the screen of maple leaves that arched the old
stone bridge, as the shifting shadows of early evening
settled down to quiet nightfall. Dorothy and
her cousin did not at once turn their steps toward
the Cedars; instead they sat there on the bridge,
enjoying the tranquil summer eve, and talking of
what might happen when all their schooldays
would be over and the long &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; of the
grown-up world would be theirs to plan for, and
theirs to shape into the rolling ball of destiny.</p>
<p>Nat declared he would be a physician, as that
particular profession had ever been to him the
greatest and noblest&mdash;to relieve human suffering.
Dorothy talked of staying home with her
brothers and father. They would need her, she
said, and it would not be fair to let Aunt Winnie
do so much for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say, Dorothy,&rdquo; broke in Nat. &ldquo;This
moonlight is all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Dorothy laughed at his attempt at sentimentality.
&ldquo;It is delightful,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if that is
what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;delightful. For real, home-made
sentiment apply to Nat White. By the
pound or barrel. Accept no substitute. Good
thing I did not decide to be a writer, eh? The
elements represent to me so many kinds of chemical
bodies, put where they belong and each one
expected to do its little part in keeping things
going. Now, I know fellows who write about the
moon&rsquo;s face and the sun&rsquo;s effulgence, just as if the
poor old sun or moon had anything to do with
the lighting-up process. I never speculate on
things beyond my reach. That sort of thing is
too hazy for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Nat, you know very well you are just
as sentimental as any one else. Didn&rsquo;t you write
some verses&mdash;once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verses? Oh, yes. But I didn&rsquo;t get mixed
with the stars. You will remember it was Ned
who said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;The stars were shining clear and bright</p>
<p class="t0">When it rained like time, that fearful night!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was the only one who stood by Ned when he
penned that stanza. It could rain like time and
be a fearful night while the stars were shining&mdash;in
China. Oh, yes, that was a great composition,
but I didn&rsquo;t happen to win out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school test of versification, to which both
had reference, brought back pleasant memories,
and Dorothy and Nat enjoyed the retrospection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Dorothy suddenly, as
something stirred at the side of the bridge on the
slope that led to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muskrat or a snake,&rdquo; suggested Nat indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, listen! That sounded like someone falling
down the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice soft fall to them then,&rdquo; remarked Nat,
without showing signs of intending to make an
investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask if anyone is there,&rdquo; timidly suggested
Dorothy.</p>
<p>At this Nat jumped up and looked over the
culvert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There sure is some one sliding down,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Hi there! Want any help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone slipped under my foot,&rdquo; came back
the answer, and the voice was unmistakably that
of a young girl or a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Nat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get down
there and give you a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The path to the brook led directly around the
bridge, and it took but a moment for the boy to
make his way to the spot whence the voice came.
Dorothy could scarcely distinguish the two figures
that kept so close to the bridge as to be in danger
of sliding under the stone arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; called Nat. &ldquo;Get hold of my hand.
I have a good grip on a strong limb, and can pull
you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it required a sturdy arm to hold on to the
tree branch and pull the girl up. Several times
Nat lost his footing and slid some distance, but
the street level was finally gained, and the strange
girl brought to the road in safety.</p>
<p>The moonlight fell across her slim figure, and
revealed the outlines of a very queer little creature
indeed. She was dark, with all the characteristics
of the Gypsy marked in her face.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Nat surveyed her critically.
Whatever could a child of her age be doing all
alone there, in that deserted place after nightfall?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the girl to Nat, as she rubbed
her bare feet on the damp grass. &ldquo;I almost fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost?&rdquo; repeated Nat, &ldquo;I thought you did
fall&mdash;you must have hit that big rock there. I
know it for I used to fish from the same place, and
it&rsquo;s not exactly a divan covered with sofa cushions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did hit my side on it,&rdquo; admitted the
girl, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Dorothy, stepping
closer to the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urania. But I&rsquo;m going to change it. I
don&rsquo;t believe in Urania any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a Gypsy girl,&rdquo; spoke Nat. &ldquo;I
thought I&rsquo;d seen you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they say I&rsquo;m a Gypsy girl, but I&rsquo;m tired
of the business and I&rsquo;m going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any place as long as it&rsquo;s not back to camp.
I left it to-night and I&rsquo;m never going back to it
again&mdash;never! never!&rdquo; and the girl shook her
disheveled head in very positive emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dorothy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young
to be out alone and at night. You must be
frightened; aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightened?&rdquo; and the girl laughed derisively.
&ldquo;What is there to be afraid of? I know
all the snakes and toads, besides the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there tramps?&rdquo; inquired Nat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But it would take a slick tramp to
catch me. Gypsy girls know how to run, if they
can&rsquo;t read and write.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>It seemed to Dorothy that this remark was
tinged with bitterness; as if the girl evidently felt
the loss of education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had better run back to the camp like
a good girl,&rdquo; pleaded Nat. &ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll walk
part of the way with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the camp! You don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;ve started out in the
world for myself, and could not go back now if I
wanted to. That woman would beat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What woman?&rdquo; Nat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one my father married. They call her
Melea. She has her own little girl and doesn&rsquo;t
care for Urania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where will you stay to-night?&rdquo; inquired
Dorothy, now anxious that the little Gypsy would
change her mind, and run back to the camp at the
foot of the hill before it would be too late&mdash;before
she might be missed from her usual place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to sleep under the bridge,&rdquo; replied
Urania calmly, &ldquo;but when I heard you talking
I came out. I love to hear pretty words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; thought Dorothy, &ldquo;like a little
human fawn. And she wants to start out in the
world for herself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard what you said about going to Dalton,&rdquo;
Urania said to Nat, as she tried to hide her embarrassment
by fingering her tattered dress, &ldquo;and
I was wondering if you could let me ride in the
back of your automobile. I want to go to the
big city and it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a far walk&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a long walk to Dalton,&rdquo; replied
Nat in surprise, &ldquo;but Dalton isn&rsquo;t a big city. Besides,
I could never help you to run away,&rdquo; he
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some boys do,&rdquo; Urania remarked with a pout.
&ldquo;I know people who run away. They come to
Melea to have their fortunes told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat and Dorothy laughed at this. It seemed
queer that persons who would run away would stop
long enough to have their fortunes told by a Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t I ride in the back of your automobile?&rdquo;
persisted the girl, not willing to let so
good a chance slip past her too easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; declared Nat. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
help you to run away in the first place, and, in the
second, I never take any girls out riding, except
my cousin and her friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t eh?&rdquo; sneered Urania. &ldquo;What
about the one with the red hair? Didn&rsquo;t I see
you out with her one day when we were camping
in the mountains&mdash;near that high-toned school,
Glendale or Glenwood or something like that.
And didn&rsquo;t she come to our camp next day to have
her fortune told? Oh, she wanted to start out in
the world for herself. You would help her, of
course, but poor Urania&mdash;she must die,&rdquo; and the
girl threw herself down upon the grass and buried
her head in the long wet spears.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Nat were too surprised to answer.
Surely the girl must refer to Tavia, but Tavia had
never ridden out alone with Nat, not even while
he was at the automobile assembly near Glenwood.
And Tavia could scarcely have gone to the fortune
teller&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I have never taken out any girl without
my mother or my cousin being along,&rdquo; Nat said,
sharply, recovering himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was your girl with another fellow,&rdquo;
declared the wily Gypsy, not willing to be caught
in an untruth. She arose from the grass and,
seeing the telling expression on the faces of her
listeners, like all of her cult, she knew she had hit
upon a fact of some kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My girl?&rdquo; repeated Nat laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the quick answer. &ldquo;She had
bright, pretty colored hair, brown eyes and her
initials are O. T. I heard her tell Melea so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The initials, O. T., must surely be those of
Octavia Travers thought Dorothy and Nat. But
Nat knew better than to press the subject further.
This cunning girl, in spite of her youth, he was
sure, would make answers to suit the questions,
and such freedom on the subject of Tavia (especially,
now, when there were enough rumors to
investigate), would simply be inviting trouble.</p>
<p>But Dorothy was not so wise in her eagerness
to hear more. She wanted to know if her chum
had really gone to the Gypsy camp from Glenwood,
but she would not deign to ask if Tavia
really went auto riding with some boys who attended
the meet. That would be too mean even
to think about! And besides, thought Dorothy
suddenly, Tavia was sick during all the time of the
automobile assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you more if you&rsquo;ll give me money,&rdquo;
boldly spoke Urania. &ldquo;I know all her fortune.
I heard Melea tell her. I was outside the tent
and I heard every word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that was against the practice of the
Gypsies,&rdquo; said Nat severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practice!&rdquo; sneered the girl. &ldquo;When a
pretty girl comes to our camp I always listen. I
like to find out what that kind think about! To
see if they are different from Urania!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Dorothy to Nat. &ldquo;We must
go. It is getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t want to hear about the girl
that is going to run away to a circus?&rdquo; called the
Gypsy as Dorothy and Nat turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, not to-night,&rdquo; replied Nat.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better run home before the constable
comes along. They put girls in jail for running
away from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do they? Then your red-headed friend
must be there now,&rdquo; called back the Gypsy with
unconcealed malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can she mean?&rdquo; asked Dorothy, clinging
to her cousin&rsquo;s arm as they hurried along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind that imp. She is just like all
her kind, trying to play on your sympathies first
and then using threats. She was listening to us
talking and picked up all she told us. She got
the initials at Glenwood&mdash;likely followed Tavia
and asked some other girl what her name was.
I remember now, there was a Gypsy settlement
there. That part&rsquo;s true enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Dorothy with a sigh.
&ldquo;I know Mrs. Pangborn positively forbade all
the girls to go near the Gypsy camps, but some of
the pupils might have met Urania on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; decided Nat. &ldquo;But she
ought to stick to the game. She&rsquo;d make a good
player. The idea of waylaying us and pretending
to have fallen down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to understand that class,&rdquo; admitted
Dorothy. &ldquo;But I hope she&rsquo;ll not stay out all
night. I should be worried if I awoke, and heard
her walking about under the trees near my window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger,&rdquo; declared Nat. &ldquo;I must go
and see that the garage is locked. She might take
a notion to turn the Fire Bird into a Pullman
sleeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, leaving Dorothy on the veranda with his
mother, Nat went around to the little auto shed,
fastened the door securely and put the key into his
pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE RUNAWAY</span></h2>
<p>Dorothy was not sure whether she dreamed
it, or really heard sounds stirring under the trees.
She had been thinking of the Gypsy girl, and
Tavia, as she fell asleep, and when she suddenly
awoke in the middle of the night, there seemed
to be some one moving about just under the window
of her room. It was so quiet that even faint
sounds could be heard, and Dorothy lay there
listening for some time, after being aroused.
Presently something banged&mdash;like a blind being
slammed back. There was no breath of wind&mdash;surely
someone must have opened the shutter!</p>
<p>The moonlight came in through the casement
and illuminated the room enough for her to see
to get up and reach her door. It was but a step
to the boys&rsquo; apartment. She would call them, she
decided, but was most anxious not to disturb her
father or aunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Strange to say when Dorothy had slipped on
her dressing gown and slippers and knocked at
the door of the boys&rsquo; room, she found them both
awake, for they had answered her light tap at
once. A moment later they were in the corridor,
attired in their big bath robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard a footstep at the side porch,&rdquo;
whispered Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake
for a long time, listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better go down,&rdquo; suggested
Dorothy nervously. &ldquo;It might be a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tramp nothing,&rdquo; declared Nat boldly, as he
made his way softly to the front door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
it&rsquo;s our friend Urania. I was sure she would call
this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the slightest fear the brothers opened
the door, and searched about for a possible intruder.
They even looked under the lilac bush
at Dorothy&rsquo;s window, but no midnight prowlers
were discovered.</p>
<p>Dorothy bravely stood at the front door, waiting
to call for more help in case the boys should
need assistance, but they finally returned from
their hunt more disgusted than alarmed. Dorothy
was entirely satisfied now that no one was
about the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that mean,&rdquo; grumbled Nat. &ldquo;I was
all primed for an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You should be careful what sort of acquaintances
you pick up after dark,&rdquo; cautioned Ned.
&ldquo;Your little Urania may turn out troublesome if
you cross her. Gypsies have a way of making
people &lsquo;pony up&rsquo; with the money, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wake the folks,&rdquo; cautioned Dorothy,
leading the way back to the sleeping rooms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a bit afraid now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if she comes back again, ask her in,&rdquo;
spoke Nat in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I think Urania
needs a talking to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy fell asleep again, after listening for
some time, and was not disturbed any further that
night, until the bright sun shining into her windows,
called her to get up to begin another day.</p>
<p>As they had planned, Nat was to start early for
Dalton. He could easily make some excuse for
his solitary trip&mdash;say that he wanted to see some
friends who were off camping, or that he wanted
to go fishing. He mentioned these two objects
vaguely as he started off.</p>
<p>Dorothy warned him not to let an inkling of
her fears concerning Tavia reach the ears of any
one in Dalton, but there was no need for this, as
Nat was as anxious as was his cousin to keep the
matter secret between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy thing to start gossip in a place
like Dalton,&rdquo; he whispered to Dorothy as he
threw in the clutch to send the auto on its way,
&ldquo;and you can depend upon me to give them another
&lsquo;think&rsquo; if they&rsquo;re looking for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Fire Bird swung out along the path Nat
turned to wave a reassuring good-bye to Dorothy
who stood on the porch watching him spin away.</p>
<p>The morning which had begun so bright and
pleasant now took on a gloomy aspect for Dorothy.
How could she wait for Nat&rsquo;s return? And what
would he find out concerning Tavia and her plans?
Suppose she should really be in Buffalo? That
would not necessarily mean that she had gone
away&mdash;she might be visiting her friend, Grace
Barnum.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible for Dorothy to become
interested in anything save Nat and his mission.
She tried to sew, but soon laid aside the dainty
little work basket Aunt Winnie had provided for
the summer hours on the porch. Then Ned invited
her to go bicycling, and she had to make
some excuse for refusing the invitation. Even
writing some letters for the major did not distract
her, and she could think of nothing but Nat and
his trip to Dalton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>But, somehow, the morning wore on, and it was
almost time for Nat to return, as Dorothy knew
in his swift car he could make the journey in
record time over the good roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure something will delay him,&rdquo; said
Dorothy to herself. &ldquo;I feel as if something will
surely happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a well-grounded fear it was for, meanwhile,
something was happening to Nat&mdash;something
quite unexpected.</p>
<p>Having reached, in due time, Dalton and the
little cottage where the Travers family dwelt, Nat
steered the machine up in front of the door.
Then he remembered he had to tighten the bolt of
the clutch pedal, and decided to do it before making
his inquiries, as it was important that the
pedal be tight. He turned back to the machine,
from which he had jumped, to get his wrench from
the tool box under the rear seat. He unbuttoned
the leather curtain that reached down to the floor
of the tonneau, and was feeling about for the
wrench when he started back in surprise.</p>
<p>There, under the seat, stretched out so as to be
concealed while the curtain was down, was Urania,
the Gypsy girl! The confined space made her
hump up like an angry cat, and her dark face
peered sharply into Nat&rsquo;s from under the leather
flap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>For a moment Nat could not find words to
speak to the girl, who remained in her hiding
place, grinning out at him with a mocking look
on her elfin face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she exclaimed presently. &ldquo;I had
a lovely ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of there instantly,&rdquo; exclaimed Nat,
in angry tones. &ldquo;How in the world did you ever
get in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, easy enough. You locked the door, but
you left the shed window open last night, and I
crawled in. I was almost a goner, though, when
you and your brother came out on the porch looking
for spooks. I was just trying your hammock
then. That&rsquo;s a softer cradle than this stuffy
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better hand you over to a constable,&rdquo;
went on Nat, realizing what it might mean
to try to drag the girl from her hiding place just
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rdquo; was the cool answer.
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve had enough of riding, and
I&rsquo;d like to stretch out a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Travers family had become
aware of the presence of the Fire Bird at their
door, and Mrs. Travers, impressed with the distinction,
had stepped back quickly to her room to
tidy herself up a bit. This gave Nat a few moments
longer to think of what he had best do with
the Gypsy girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to her, rather fiercely, &ldquo;you
just stay under that seat until I&rsquo;m ready to take
you to a place of safety. Now, if you dare to
move while I&rsquo;m in this house I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have you
arrested,&rdquo; and with that Nat fastened down the
curtain securely, with a catch that snapped on the
outside and was incapable, as he supposed, of being
opened from the inside.</p>
<p>He walked up the path to the front door and,
after a few seconds, his knock was answered by
Mrs. Travers. With unlimited protestations of
welcome she showed Nat in, and offered him a seat
in the far corner of the room, some distance from
the front windows. He felt that he had better
keep his eye on the machine, because of his concealed
passenger, so, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
he took a chair near the front of the apartment,
remarking, as he did so, what a pretty view there
was from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you to Dalton?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Travers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was&mdash;er&mdash;just passing through, and I
thought I&rsquo;d stop to inquire&mdash;about the family.
Dorothy would like to know,&rdquo; said Nat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re about as well as usual,&rdquo; said Tavia&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Tavia? Is she home?&rdquo; asked Nat
quickly, feeling that this was as good an opening
as he could desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;m very sorry, for she&rsquo;d be delighted
to see you. She went to Buffalo just after coming
from school. We scarcely had a good look at
her. I wanted her to stay home for a week, but
she was so set on going that she started off bag
and baggage, and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t say when she
will be home. Of course she&rsquo;s with friends,&rdquo; the
mother hastened to add, seeing the look of surprise
that flashed over Ned&rsquo;s face in spite of his
effort at self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin, Dorothy, wrote to her,&rdquo; Nat hastened
to say, to cover his confusion, &ldquo;and, not
receiving an answer, thought it likely that she
might be ill, or away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia&rsquo;s father forwarded the letter to her,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Travers. &ldquo;She should have answered it
by this time. We have only had one souvenir card
from her since she went away, but it was a real
pretty one; I&rsquo;d like to show it to you, but I guess
I&rsquo;ve mislaid it. I can&rsquo;t think where I put it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I suppose it takes some time
for a letter to travel when it&rsquo;s been forwarded
from one place to another. I dare say Dorothy
will soon hear from her. I&rsquo;m glad all the family
are well. Major Dale is always glad to hear news
of the Dalton folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And indeed we all miss the major,&rdquo; spoke
Mrs. Travers with a show of feeling. &ldquo;Not to
say we don&rsquo;t miss the entire family, for the boys
were fine little fellows, and, as for Dorothy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intended tribute to Dorothy ended with a
little catch in Mrs. Travers&rsquo;s voice, for she was
very fond of her daughter&rsquo;s companion, and sometimes
showed her feelings with a touch of sentimentality.</p>
<p>Then, as Nat was really in a hurry (for he
could not stop thinking of Urania under the seat)
he made his excuses as quickly and as politely as
the circumstances would allow, and was soon out
of the house. He lost no time in cranking up
and, in a few minutes, was chug-chugging at top
speed down the country road.</p>
<p>He had made up his mind to take the Gypsy
girl back to North Birchland, and was vaguely
wondering, as he dashed along, why she did not
knock on the seat and demand to be let out of her
uncomfortable quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stop and just take a look at her.
She may be crying,&rdquo; the lad remarked to himself,
and, bringing the machine to a halt alongside the
road, he stepped out.</p>
<p>He assumed a determined look before unfastening
the curtain, for he was bound not to let his
sympathies run away with him in dealing with the
unruly girl. He shoved back the catch and raised
the leather flap.</p>
<p>Urania was gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; cried Nat aloud, so
great was his astonishment at the second surprise
the Gypsy had given him. &ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t a dandy!
How in the world did she slip out without me seeing
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nat had forgotten the few moments when
he sat on the sofa at the rear side of Mrs. Travers&rsquo;s
parlor, some distance from the front windows,
and it was in those few moments that Urania had
managed to undo the catch, in spite of its supposed
security, and slip out of the Fire Bird.
Swiftly, as no girl but a Gypsy can run, she had
fled down the street, across the Dalton bridge, and
into the deep woods beyond, where she would have
time to plan out the remainder of her day&rsquo;s
travels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s gone&mdash;good riddance,&rdquo; thought
Nat, as he started up the machine once more, and
turned, at a swift speed, into the turnpike leading
to North Birchland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">A SPELL OF THE &ldquo;GLUMPS&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Whizzing along the road Nat tried to decide
how it would be best to break the disappointing
news to Dorothy. Of his escapade with
Urania he had fully determined not to say a word.
Dorothy had enough girls to worry about, he
argued, and if she heard of this one she would
form a searching expedition, and set out at once
to hunt the Gypsy who, Nat thought, was like a
human squirrel and able to take care of herself.</p>
<p>The return trip seemed shorter than that which
took Nat out to Dalton, and as the Fire Bird
swung into the Cedars&rsquo; entrance somewhat later
than the youth expected to get back, Dorothy was
at the gate awaiting to hear news of Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffalo,&rdquo; announced Nat sententiously, as
Dorothy came up beside the car which jerked to
a stop amid a screeching of the brake. &ldquo;She
went there some time ago. She&rsquo;s at Grace Barnum&rsquo;s.
Wait. I have the address.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Without delaying to put the machine up, Nat
produced a slip of paper upon which he had written,
at Mrs. Travers&rsquo;s direction, the street and
number of Miss Barnum&rsquo;s residence. He handed
it to Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; asked Dorothy,
looking at the directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it is. Everybody in Dalton is as
chipper as possible. You&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s
worrying. Now, if I were you, I&rsquo;d just let up,
Doro. You&rsquo;ll be down sick if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am foolish. And I have given you
a lot of trouble,&rdquo; spoke up the girl a little sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble? Nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Nat. &ldquo;I
just like the lark. When you want any more
sleuthing done apply at headquarters. I&rsquo;m the
gum-shoe man for this section,&rdquo; and at that he
turned his attention to the Fire Bird, while Dorothy
walked thoughtfully back to the house.</p>
<p>Poor Dorothy! An instinctive foreboding of
danger had taken possession of her now, and,
try as she did to dispel it, an unmistakable voice
seemed to call out to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find Tavia! She needs you, Dorothy Dale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought Dorothy, &ldquo;she has run
away and is really with some circus troupe, as the
Gypsy girl said. Or perhaps she is at some watering
place, taking part in a play&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>This last possibility was the one that Dorothy
dreaded most to dwell upon. Tavia must have
loved the stage, else why did she constantly do
the things she did at school, so like a little actress,
and so like a girl &ldquo;stage-struck,&rdquo; as Aunt Winnie
called it?</p>
<p>These and similar fancies floated through Dorothy&rsquo;s
brain hour after hour, in spite of whatever
diversion presented itself for her amusement.</p>
<p>The afternoon, following Nat&rsquo;s trip to Dalton,
Dorothy, with her brothers, Roger and Joe, went
to gather pond lilies near the waterfall. It was
a delightful day, and the sun glistened on the quiet
sheet of the mill pond, making liquid diamonds.
The lilies, of which there was an abundance,
looked like carved wax that had frozen the sun&rsquo;s
gold in each heart. But, somehow, Dorothy,
could not work up her usual enthusiasm in gathering
the blossoms.</p>
<p>It was delightful to dip her hands into the cool
stream and surely to hear little Roger prattle
was an inspiration, but all the while Dorothy was
thinking of crowded Buffalo, and wondering what
a certain girl might be doing there on that summer
afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>In the evening Major Dale and Mrs. White,
taking Dorothy with them, went for a drive
along the broad boulevard that was the pride of
that exclusive summer place&mdash;North Birchland.
Dorothy tried bravely to rouse herself from her
gloomy reveries but, in spite of her efforts, Mrs.
White complained that her niece was not like her
usual self&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps not feeling well,&rdquo; she ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;glumpy&rsquo; ever since I left Glenwood,&rdquo;
admitted Dorothy. &ldquo;Not because I want to be,
nor that I am not having a most delightful time,
but I simply have the &lsquo;glumps.&rsquo; At Glenwood
they prescribe extra work for an attack like this,&rdquo;
and the girl laughed at her own diagnosis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly should dispel the &lsquo;glumps,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Mrs. White. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what could
produce an attack here at the Cedars, with all your
own folks around you, Dorothy, dear. I do believe
you are lonely for those impossible girls.
What do you say to paying some of them a little
visit, just to break in on your holiday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, aunty,&rdquo; protested Dorothy, &ldquo;I am
perfectly content. What sort of girl would I be
to want to run away and leave you all after being
away so long at school? No, indeed, I&rsquo;ll stay
right here at the beautiful Cedars, and I&rsquo;ll try to
be a better girl&mdash;to get rid at once of my spell
of the &lsquo;glumps&rsquo; as we used to call them at Glenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But girls are girls,&rdquo; insisted her aunt, &ldquo;and
you have no control, my dear, over such sentiment
as I imagine you are afflicted with at present. Just
plan out a little trip somewhere and, I&rsquo;ll vouch for
it, the visit to some giggling Dolly Varden of a
girl will do you no end of good. And then, too,
you may invite her back here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White divined too well the reason for
Dorothy&rsquo;s &ldquo;blue spell.&rdquo; She could see perfectly
how much her niece missed the light-hearted Tavia,
and in advising her to take a little trip Mrs.
White was sure Dorothy would choose to go
where her chum might be.</p>
<p>In this she was right, but concerning what
Dorothy might do to reach Tavia Mrs. White
had no idea. She merely suggested a &ldquo;little trip
somewhere,&rdquo; believing Dorothy would find Tavia,
either in Dalton, or visiting some girl friend, as
Dorothy had told her Tavia intended doing. But
circumstances conspired to give Dorothy the very
opportunity she longed for&mdash;she would go somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;to
look for her &ldquo;sister-friend&rdquo;&mdash;the
girl who had been to her more
than friend and almost a sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Ned and Nat had planned a trip to Buffalo at
the beginning of their vacation. They were to
meet a number of their chums there, and do some
exploring in the neighborhood of Niagara Falls.
They were to make the journey in the Fire Bird,
and when Mrs. White suggested a trip for Dorothy
it was the run to Buffalo, in the automobile,
that immediately came into the girl&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only could go with the boys,&rdquo; she pondered.
&ldquo;But what excuse would I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the next day she turned the subject over in
her mind. Then something very remarkable
happened. Persons who believe in thought controlling
matter would not call the incident out of
the ordinary perhaps, but, be that as it may, when
Dorothy strolled down to the post-office, having a
slender hope of a letter from Tavia, she did find
a letter in the box&mdash;a letter from Rose-Mary
Markin, stating that she, and her mother, were
going to Buffalo and Niagara Falls for a few
days, and, as Buffalo was only about a day&rsquo;s trip
from North Birchland, perhaps Dorothy could
take a &ldquo;run&rdquo; to Buffalo, and spend a few days
with them.</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s head thumped when she read the
letter. The very thing of all others she would
have wished for, had she been as wise as the unknown
fate that worked it out for her, without
any action on her own part!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>She felt light enough now to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; over the
road back to the Cedars, to show the invitation to
Mrs. White. The boys were to leave for Buffalo
the next day, so there was little time to be
lost, should Major Dale and Mrs. White think it
best for Dorothy to make the trip. How the
girl trembled while waiting for the decision.
What if she should be disappointed? It was a
long ride in the auto&mdash;but with her cousins&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. White read Rose-Mary&rsquo;s little note a second
time while Dorothy stood there waiting. The
aunt noticed how delicately Rose-Mary indicated
her own mother&rsquo;s anxiety to meet Dorothy, and
then with what a nicety the whole matter was referred
to Major Dale and Dorothy&rsquo;s aunt. This
carefully written note, neither stilted nor indifferent
in its tone, convinced Mrs. White at once that
the writer was exactly the girl Dorothy had described
her to be&mdash;her very best friend at Glenwood&mdash;excepting
only Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t go with the
boys,&rdquo; spoke her aunt finally. &ldquo;They are always
careful, and if you leave here, as they intend to do,
at sunrise (that will be an experience for you) you
should get into Buffalo in time for the evening
dinner. I&rsquo;ll just sound the major,&rdquo; giving Dorothy
a loving embrace. &ldquo;Not that a mere man,
even be he Major Dale, can hold out against two
such Sampson-like wills as ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>From that moment, until the time of her stepping
into the Fire Bird next morning, and waving
a good-bye to the little party that stood on the
porch to see them off, it all seemed like the strangest,
subtlest dream to Dorothy. She was going to
find Tavia&mdash;going herself to look for her, and
find out for herself all the questions that, for
weeks, had been eating away her happiness with
dreaded uncertainties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">DOROTHY IN BUFFALO</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; remarked Ned after they had
skimmed along for awhile, &ldquo;I suppose, Dorothy,
you can&rsquo;t deny me the long-looked for opportunity
of meeting the sweetest girl in Glenwood (according
to you) Cologne&mdash;Rose-Mary Markin, to be
exact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you will like her, Ned. She certainly
is a very sweet girl,&rdquo; replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing for me. I have been looking
for that brand for some time. And now, O Edward,
prepare thyself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your wheel!&rdquo; cried Nat, for Ned had
raised his right hand in the air to give emphasis
to his dramatic utterance and came close to a large
stone. &ldquo;Save that for later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Dorothy was as bright and animated as possible
during the trip and chatted with the boys about
the Glenwood girls, giving a full share of praise to
Cologne. After all, Dorothy reflected, Ned was
a young man, handsome, and, in many ways, desirable,
and it would be nice if he were to take the
two girls around Buffalo. But this thought was
overshadowed by another&mdash;If Tavia were only
with them. What good times they might have!
Tavia and Nat always got along so well together.
Each seemed to be an inspiration of mirth to the
other.</p>
<p>But Tavia!</p>
<p>Nat seemed quiet, and even serious as they
speeded along the lonely country roads. His
brother was not slow to notice the unusual look of
concern and attempted to &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Nat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The worst is yet
to come,&rdquo; and he made a wry face. &ldquo;You know
we expect to find your little friend somewhere out
this way. I really wouldn&rsquo;t want a corner on happiness.
I do feel, somehow, that Cologne will be
my fate, but that is no reason why you and Doro
shouldn&rsquo;t hitch on to the band wagon. Let me
see, Doro, you say she has brown eyes and blue
hair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned! You must not make fun of Cologne&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun of her! As soon bite my own tongue.
I said it sideways by mistake. It should have
read blue eyes and brown hair. Wasn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; admitted Dorothy.
&ldquo;And she has the most adorable little mouth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here, Nat! Get hold of this wheel. I
really must have a chance to think that over. Say
it again, Dorothy, please,&rdquo; and the lad went
through a series of queer antics, that seem so very
funny when the right boy attempts to be funny, but
so very flat when one tries to either describe them
or imitate the original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t there a brother in this visit to Buffalo?&rdquo;
asked Nat drolly.</p>
<p>In spite of herself the color flew to Dorothy&rsquo;s
cheeks. Of course Rose-Mary had a brother, two
years older than herself. But Dorothy had never
met him, although Rose-Mary talked so much at
school of Jack, that Dorothy almost felt acquainted
with the youth. But now she would certainly
meet the family for they were all together at the
Buffalo hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; chimed in Ned. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dorothy. &ldquo;I believe there
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I call that real jolly,&rdquo; went on Ned.
&ldquo;Just one apiece&mdash;if Nat finds Tavia, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hours later the Fire Bird swung up to the
portico of a leading Buffalo hotel, and, scarcely
had the puffing machine come to a stop than a girl
in lavender, with blue eyes and brown hair, had
Dorothy in her arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear, old sweetheart!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rose-Mary, as she embraced Dorothy with that
effusion of delight peculiar to schoolgirls and
babies, as Nat remarked in a whisper to Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were so good to think of me,&rdquo; Dorothy
tried to say, from the midst of the embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of you! As if I ever forgot you for
one single moment!&rdquo; Then Rose-Mary turned
to the two boys in the auto and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my cousins,&rdquo; began Dorothy.
&ldquo;This is Mr. Edward White and the other one,&rdquo;&mdash;with
a little laugh,&mdash;&ldquo;is his brother Nathaniel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys bowed and made what were probably
intended for complimentary acknowledgments of
the introduction, but which were mere murmurs.
Rose-Mary, however with the usual advantage of
girls over boys in such matters, showed no embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one real nice thing about Dorothy,&rdquo;
spoke Nat when he had, in a measure recovered
his composure. &ldquo;She always makes Ned my
brother. That counts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>The girls laughed merrily and then a tall young
man, the &ldquo;very image of Rose-Mary only taller,&rdquo;
according to Dorothy, stepped down to the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; called Rose-Mary. &ldquo;Come here instanter
and get acquainted with Dorothy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at the group. His eyes plainly
said &ldquo;only with Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, help yourself! Help yourself!&rdquo; cried
Ned, laughing at the confusion Cologne&rsquo;s speech
had caused. &ldquo;We will be &lsquo;among those present&rsquo;
if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know very well what I mean!&rdquo; and
Rose-Mary shot a challenging look at Ned. &ldquo;I
want you all to be the very best of friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, thanks!&rdquo; exclaimed Nat, as he and
his brother bowed in mock deference. &ldquo;We
promise, I assure. We&rsquo;ll do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys are all just alike,&rdquo; stammered Dorothy&rsquo;s
host. &ldquo;A pack of teases! Come along
Dorothy. Mother is waiting to welcome you.
Jack, perhaps you will tell Dorothy&rsquo;s cousins what
to do with their machine. I guess you know how
to get acquainted with them without any more introductions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was said with a defiant look at Ned,
who returned it with just the suspicion of a smile.
In effect his look said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lavender, you have met a boy who may
be like other boys, but he is particularly himself&mdash;Ned
White&mdash;and he just loves to tease girls&mdash;like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose-Mary was leading Dorothy up the broad
steps to the hotel entrance. She turned to see
what the boys were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I declare!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There
they&rsquo;ve all gone for a ride! I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll have
a jolly time. What nice boys your cousins are.
Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you could come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotel veranda was thronged with persons
enjoying the approach of twilight, for the auto
party had not made a hurried trip, having stopped
for lunch on the way. It seemed to Dorothy that
the chairs were mostly filled with stout ladies with
blond hair. She had never before seen so many
blonds in one group.</p>
<p>Rose-Mary led the way into the parlor and escorted
Dorothy up to a smiling, pretty woman,
with such beautiful white hair&mdash;the kind that
goes with brown eyes and seems to add to their
sparkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, dear, this is Dorothy,&rdquo; said Rose-Mary.
&ldquo;She must be tired after her long, dusty
ride. Shall we go upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to meet you, my dear,&rdquo; declared
Mrs. Markin, warmly. &ldquo;Daughter talks so
much about you. Yes, Rosie, do take Dorothy
upstairs and let her refresh herself. It must be
a very long ride from North Birchland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not the least tired,&rdquo; protested the visitor.
&ldquo;So don&rsquo;t go upstairs, if you were enjoying
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air indeed!&rdquo; echoed Rose-Mary, slipping her
arm through Dorothy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Mother, will you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Markin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let
you have Dorothy all to yourself for awhile. I
just know how many things you will want to talk
about. Later, after dinner, I&rsquo;ll claim you both.
But I&rsquo;m going to improve this time to write a few
belated letters. The desk is clear so I can do them
down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose-Mary left Dorothy while she made a place
for her mother at the little private desk in the
ladies&rsquo; sitting room, then the two girls took the
elevator, in the broad hall, and soon Dorothy
found herself in a cozy room, with a dainty white
bed, and pretty flouncings&mdash;Rose-Mary&rsquo;s apartment
of course, which she had surrendered to her
guest for the visit, while Cologne would share her
mother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make yourself comfortable,&rdquo; began
Rose-Mary, assisting Dorothy to lay aside her
auto wraps. &ldquo;Perhaps you want to wash. Here
are the things,&rdquo; and she pulled open a little door,
disclosing a bathroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it charming here,&rdquo; Dorothy said as she
at once began to make herself presentable for dinner.
&ldquo;I have a blue dress in my bag,&rdquo; indicating
one the porter had brought up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drag it out,&rdquo; commanded her companion.
&ldquo;You must wear blue. I have told Jack how
heavenly you look in blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have whispered to Ned how angelic
you look in&mdash;lavender,&rdquo; interrupted Dorothy,
not to be outdone in bestowing compliments.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Ned a lovely&mdash;boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very saucy, I should say,&rdquo; and Cologne
laughed mischievously. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll try to be nice
to him on your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope I&rsquo;ll not say anything to hurt Jack&rsquo;s
feelings,&rdquo; spoke Dorothy, still keeping in with her
friend&rsquo;s humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t! He hasn&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; declared Rose-Mary.
&ldquo;He drives me frantic when I really
want to make him mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do look lovely in that lavender
gown,&rdquo; insisted Dorothy, with unmistakable admiration.
&ldquo;I believe you have grown prettier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Comparative degrees, eh?&rdquo; and she made a
queer little face. &ldquo;Now, Doro dear, you must
say I&rsquo;ve grown positively handsome. I will never
be content with the little, insignificant comparative
degree in a suite of rooms like these. Aren&rsquo;t they
really scrumptious? You know dad couldn&rsquo;t
come, and he was so anxious that we would be
comfortable, that the dear old darling just wired
for good rooms, and that&rsquo;s how we got these.
They&rsquo;re good, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy looked out of the broad window, down
at the big city stretched before her view. She
could not help thinking of Tavia, although she
thought it best not to speak of her to Rose-Mary&mdash;just
yet at least. Cologne was busy hanging
up the things she had pulled out of Dorothy&rsquo;s bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long can you stay?&rdquo; she asked, shaking
out Dorothy&rsquo;s light blue linen frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was the queerest thing! Aunt Winnie
got it into her head that I needed some of the
girls, and she proposed a little trip for me, just
as your letter came. It seemed providential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providential? That&rsquo;s what I call dead lucky,
girlie. You can&rsquo;t expect a real proper providence
to get mixed up in all our little scrapes. And, to
be honest, I&rsquo;m just dying for a real genuine scrape.
The kind Tavia used to &lsquo;hand out&rsquo; to us at Glenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Dorothy smiled but did not reply. Somehow
the idea of Tavia still being kept busy &ldquo;handing
out scrapes&rdquo; struck her as somewhat significant.</p>
<p>Presently the boys returned, which fact was
made known by a shrill whistle over the private
telephone in the apartment, and Jack&rsquo;s voice following
with a command for &ldquo;Rosie&rdquo; to come
down.</p>
<p>The girls found the three boys and Mrs. Markin
waiting for them, Ned and Nat having declined
Jack&rsquo;s invitation to take dinner with him at
the hotel. They said they had to be off to meet
the youths with whom they had arranged to stop
while in Buffalo.</p>
<p>Dorothy wanted so much to ask Nat to take
her to look for Tavia. She felt she would not
sleep until she found the house of Tavia&rsquo;s friend,
Grace Barnum, but she was too uncertain of Tavia&rsquo;s
whereabouts to say openly that she wanted
to go to the address that Nat had brought her
from Mrs. Travers.</p>
<p>The Fire Bird had been left in quarters provided
by the boys of the &ldquo;Get There&rdquo; club, members
of which were to be Ned&rsquo;s and Nat&rsquo;s guests,
and the two Birchland youths were thus free to
walk about the big city that evening. Perhaps
Dorothy might also go for a walk, with Rose-Mary
and Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>But, Dorothy, as she reflected on this possibility,
realized that it would not afford her an opportunity
of getting to Grace Barnum&rsquo;s. It would
not do for the entire party to go there, Dorothy
felt, as she could never allow any one to suspect
her anxiety concerning Tavia. Only Nat was in
the secret so far, and even he was not made fully
aware of all it involved and of its depth&mdash;he did
not know why Dorothy was so anxious&mdash;or that
she had any other than a foolish schoolgirl whim
urging her on.</p>
<p>So, in spite of all the surroundings and excitement,
incident to life in a big hotel with its many
strange phases, Dorothy kept turning the question
over and over in her mind. How should she go
about her search for Tavia? Just as she expected
the party planned to go out that first evening of
her visit to &ldquo;look over the town.&rdquo; All were going
except Mrs. Markin, and she consented to let
the young folks enjoy themselves without her
chaperonage, on account of the circumstances and
the number who were going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Ned and Nat both essayed to look after Rose-Mary,
and this added to the merry-making, since,
when one lad would attempt some courtesy the
other would immediately undertake to outdo him.
Dorothy found Jack Markin splendid company,
and this, she told herself, could not be otherwise,
since he was brother to Cologne.</p>
<p>At a pretty palm-festooned ice-cream parlor
they met a friend of the Markin family, Alma
Mason, who was also a visitor in Buffalo. She
was bright and interesting, chatting pleasantly on
many subjects, until, to Dorothy&rsquo;s surprise, she
asked abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know a Grace Barnum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dorothy answered, as she felt her face
burning with excitement. &ldquo;I do not know her
personally, but she is a friend of a chum of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty girl, with the golden-brown hair?
Oh, I have met her,&rdquo; Alma went on, taking Dorothy&rsquo;s
look to signify the correctness of the guess
that the &ldquo;pretty girl with the brown hair&rdquo; was
Dorothy&rsquo;s friend. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she splendid? Grace
was just wild over her&mdash;she was so jolly and
funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Miss Mason used the past tense Dorothy
instantly noticed. Nat was also listening with interest,
and he observed the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she not with Miss Barnum now?&rdquo; Dorothy
found courage to inquire finally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. I think Grace said she had
gone to Rochester. She has, I believe, a friend
in that city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy was startled at the news that Tavia
had left Buffalo. Her heart sank, but she tried
to conceal her feelings. Tavia in Rochester!
The girl in Rochester was she who had once written
Tavia concerning the stage and its attractions.
And Tavia possibly was with her, after she had
promised to have no further correspondence with
that press agent!</p>
<p>The remainder of the evening was like a blank
page to Dorothy. She heard and saw what was
going on around her, but her heart and her attention
was not with the merry little party from the
hotel. Jack Markin would have accused her of
being dull had he not determined to meet more
than half way his sister&rsquo;s estimate of Dorothy
Dale. Then too, he reasoned as an excuse for her
obvious low spirits, she must be tired after the
long, dusty auto run.</p>
<p>The evening passed quickly (to all but Dorothy)
amid a variety of entertainments, and when
the boys from North Birchland said good-night
in the hotel office and Rose-Mary had taken Dorothy
to her room, it was quite late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>It was a relief, however, Dorothy had to admit
to herself at least, and in her heart she was grateful
to Mrs. Markin when that lady cautioned the
two girls against further talking, and urged Dorothy
to go to bed. For Dorothy wanted to be
alone and think. She wanted to plan. How
should she proceed now? If Tavia was not with
Grace Barnum&mdash;</p>
<p>But of this she must first make certain, and to
do so she would ask Nat to take her to Miss Barnum&rsquo;s
house the first thing next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">AT THE PLAY</span></h2>
<p>But little light was thrown on the disappearance
of Tavia through any information Dorothy
could obtain from Grace Barnum. In fact that
young lady was quite as puzzled as was Dorothy,
and when told that Tavia was not to be found at
home a few days previous (this being within the
time when Tavia had left Buffalo ostensibly for
her residence in Dalton), Miss Barnum wanted to
communicate immediately with the missing girl&rsquo;s
parents.</p>
<p>Nat, with kind consideration, had declined to
step inside when Dorothy called at the Barnum
home. He thought he might better give the two
young ladies a chance to discuss the situation alone,
and so, under pretense of strolling through the little
park opposite the house, left Grace and Dorothy
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>It took the girls but a moment to arrive at the
same point of interest. Grace showed keenest
anxiety when Dorothy inquired for Tavia, for she
had fears of her own&mdash;since her friend&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must write at once,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;What
would Mrs. Travers think of me if anything happened
to Tavia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have already begun a letter,&rdquo; stated
Dorothy, truthfully enough, &ldquo;so perhaps I had
better make the inquiry. You know how excitable
Mrs. Travers is. Perhaps I could write without
causing her any alarm, whereas she would
surely expect you to know whether or not Tavia
was home. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt but that
she is home&mdash;now,&rdquo; Dorothy hastened to add.
&ldquo;I am expecting her at North Birchland any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had the effect of putting Grace at her ease.
Of course, she reflected, Tavia might even be at
the Cedars now, as her mother had given her permission
to go about almost as she wished, and she
had expected to pay a number of visits to friends,
no special time being set for them. This Grace
knew for she had seen a letter to that effect from
Mrs. Travers to Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Dorothy, rising to go, &ldquo;they
have always given Tavia so much her own way.
She has been&mdash;well, sort of superior to the others
at home. That, I think, is a real mistake, for a
girl is expected to know more of the world and
its ways than is consistent with her actual experience.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; admitted Grace. &ldquo;That is what I
thought once when Tavia acted so&mdash;well so self-reliant.
I do hope she is safe at home. You will
let me know, won&rsquo;t you Dorothy? I may call you
that, mayn&rsquo;t I? I feel as if I had known you for
a long time, as Tavia has talked so much about
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two girls parted, and Dorothy&rsquo;s heart
seemed to grow heavier at each new turn in her
quest for the missing one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Tavia act so?&rdquo; she asked herself
over and over again, as she walked along
with Nat who tried to cheer her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop worrying, Doro,&rdquo; he counseled
as he noted the look of anxiety on her face,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be a sick girl &rsquo;way out here in Buffalo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be excused from the party to-night,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;I really have a headache,
and I must have time to write some letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great headache cure&mdash;letter writing. But
I suppose you&rsquo;ll not rest until you sift this matter
to the very bottom. And, to be honest, Doro, I
can&rsquo;t say I blame you. I&rsquo;d give a whole lot, right
now, to know where the wily Tavia tarries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>As discreetly as she could, Dorothy wrote the
letter to Mrs. Travers to ask the mooted question.
She did not say she had been to Grace Barnum&rsquo;s,
but simply inquired for Tavia&rsquo;s address. On an
early mail the next day (a remarkable thing for
Mrs. Travers to answer a letter so promptly)
came the reply that Tavia was at the Barnums!
There was some other news of Dalton in the
epistle, but that concerning Tavia, which her mother
had apparently set down as a matter of fact,
stood out prominently from all the rest.</p>
<p>In spite of her fears, when the letter presented
the actual fact that Tavia was not at home, and,
as Dorothy knew she was not at Grace&rsquo;s, it came
like a shock to the girl already in a highly nervous
state because of what she had gone through.
Hoping against hope she had clung to the slim
possibility that some explanation might come from
Dalton, but now even this was shattered.</p>
<p>One thing Dorothy quickly decided upon. She
must have another talk with Alma Mason, and she
must be careful not to excite suspicion as to the
real purpose of the conversation.</p>
<p>Realizing at once that she must now move cautiously
in the matter, for the slightest intimation
that Tavia was away from home and friends, without
either the latter or relatives having a clue to
her whereabouts, would be sure to ruin Tavia&rsquo;s
reputation, Dorothy now determined that even Nat
should not know of her plans for continuing the
search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>How hopeless Dorothy felt all alone in such a
work! But find Tavia she must, and to find her
very soon she felt was imperative, for, even in Buffalo,
with her friends, Dorothy could see the
dangers of a large city to an unprotected and unsuspecting
young girl.</p>
<p>But the boys were going back to North Birchland
the next day! How could Dorothy act in
time to get to Rochester? For to Rochester she felt
that she now must go. Everything pointed to the
fact that Tavia was either there, or that there a
clue to her whereabouts could be obtained.</p>
<p>On taking her morning walk alone, for Rose-Mary
was a little indisposed, after the party of
the evening previous, Dorothy met Miss Mason.
It was not difficult to renew the conversation concerning
Tavia. Bit by bit Alma told of Tavia&rsquo;s
infatuation for the stage, until Dorothy became
more than ever convinced that it was in theatrical
surroundings that the missing girl would be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Mrs. Markin had planned a little theatre party
for Rose-Mary and some of her Buffalo friends
that afternoon. The play was one especially interesting
to young girls&mdash;a drama built on lines,
showing how one ambitious girl succeeded in the
world with nothing but a kind heart and a worthy
purpose to start with. It abounded in scenes of
rural home life, wholesome and picturesque, and
one of the features, most conspicuous in the advertising
on the billboards was that of the character
Katherine, the heroine, holding a neighborhood
meeting in a cornfield, among the laborers during
the noon hour. The girl appeared in the posters
perched upon a water barrel and from that pulpit
in the open she, as the daughter of a blind chair
caner, won hearts to happiness with the gospel of
brotherly love&mdash;the new religion of the poor and
the oppressed.</p>
<p>While Rose-Mary and Alma enthused over the
prospect of a particularly pleasant afternoon, Dorothy
seemed nervous, and it was with some misgivings
that she finally agreed to attend the party
that was really arranged for her special entertainment.
The boys, Ned, Nat and Jack were going,
of course, and to make the affair complete Rose-Mary
had also invited Grace Barnum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Grace was a particularly bright girl, the sort
that cares more for books than pretty clothes, and
who had the temerity to wear her hair parted directly
in the middle in the very wildest of pompadour
days. Not that Grace lacked beauty, for she
was of the classic type that seems to defy nationality
to such an extent, that it might be a matter of
most uncertain guess to say to what country her
ancestors had belonged.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; was a source of constant delight
to Grace, for each new friend would undertake
to assign her to a different country, and so she
felt quite like the &ldquo;real thing in Cosmopolitan
types&rdquo; as she expressed it. The fact, however,
might have been accounted for by the incident of
Grace having been born under missionary skies in
China. Her mother was an American blond, her
father a dark foreigner of French and Spanish ancestry
and, with all this there was in the Barnum
family a distinct strain, of Puritan stock, from
which the name Barnum came. Grace, being distinctly
different from other girls, no doubt attracted
Tavia to her, and now, when received among
Tavia&rsquo;s friends she was welcomed with marked attention
that at once established a bond of friendship
between her and the other girls.</p>
<p>The boys, naturally, were not slow to &ldquo;discover
her&rdquo; so that, altogether, the little matinee party,
when it had reached the theatre, was a very merry
throng of young people. Mrs. Markin acted as
chaperone and, five minutes before the time set
for the play to begin Dorothy and her friends sat
staring at the green fire-proof curtain from a
roomy box. Dorothy was like one in a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>All about her the others were eagerly waiting,
looking the while at the programmes, but Dorothy
sat there with the pink leaflet lying unheeded in
her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much that picture of Katherine resembles
Tavia,&rdquo; was the thought that disturbed her.
&ldquo;The same hair&mdash;the same eyes&mdash;what if it
should be she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain was swaying to and fro as those behind
it brushed past in their preparations for the
presentation of &ldquo;Katherine, the Chair Caner&rsquo;s
Daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s heart beat wildly when she fancied
Tavia amid such scenes&mdash;Tavia the open-hearted
girl, the little Dalton &ldquo;wild flower&rdquo; as Dorothy
liked to call her. Surely no stage heroine could
be more heroic than she had always been in her
role of shedding happiness on all who came within
her sphere of life.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rose-Mary turned to Nat and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Tavia would enjoy this.&rdquo; She looked
around on the gay scene as the theatre was filling
up. &ldquo;What a pity we could not bring her with
us for the good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Dorothy felt her face flush as Nat made some
irrelevant reply. Jack turned directly to Dorothy
and, noting her inattention to the programme
opened his to point out some of the items of interest.</p>
<p>But still Dorothy stared nervously at the big asbestos
curtain and made feeble efforts to answer
her companion&rsquo;s questions. Even Mrs. Markin
observed Dorothy&rsquo;s rather queer manner, and she,
too, showed concern that her daughter&rsquo;s guest
should be ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well, dear?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>Dorothy fumbled with a lace flounce on her
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but there is so much to
see and think about.&rdquo; She felt as if she were
apologizing. &ldquo;I am not accustomed to city theatres,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>Then the orchestra broke into the opening number,
and presently a flash of light across the curtain
told that the players were ready to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The introductory scenes were rather of an amateur
order&mdash;a poor country home&mdash;the blind
chair caner at work, and his more or less amusing
customers. One flashily-dressed woman wanted
him to put a rush bottom in a chair that had belonged
to her grandmother, but absolutely refused
to pay even the very low price the caner asked for
the work. She wanted it as cheaply as though
rush bottoms could be made by machinery. He
was poor and needed work but he could not accept
her terms.</p>
<p>The woman in a red silk gown, with a bewildering
shower of veils floating about her, did not gain
any applause for her part in the play. Dorothy
noted that even on the stage undesirable persons
do not please, and that the assumed character is
taken into account as well as their acting.</p>
<p>It was when the blind man sat alone at his door
step, with his sightless eyes raised pitifully to the
inviting sunset, that the pretty Katherine came
skipping into view across the footlights.</p>
<p>Instinctively Nat reached out and, without being
observed grasped Dorothy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;How
like Tavia!&rdquo; he mused, while Dorothy actually
seemed to stop breathing. From that moment to
the very end of the play Nat and Dorothy shared
the same thought&mdash;it might be Tavia. The others
had each remarked the resemblance, but, being
more interested in the drama than in the whereabouts
of Dorothy&rsquo;s chum (whom they had no
occasion to worry about for they did not know the
circumstances,) they merely dwelt on it as a passing
thought&mdash;they were interested in what happened
to the chair caner&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>At last every member of the company found
some excuse to get on the stage, and then the end
was reached, and the curtain went down while the
throng hurried out, seemingly indifferent to the desire
of the actors to show themselves again as the
curtain shot up for a final display of the last scene.</p>
<p>The Markin party was to go to a restaurant
for ice-cream, and so hurried from the box. Dorothy
drifted along with them for a few moments,
and then again that one thought came to her, overwhelming
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if that should really be Tavia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had but a moment to act, then, when the
crowd pressed closer and there was difficulty in
walking because of the blockade, Dorothy slipped
back, stepped out of her place, and was at once
swallowed up in a sea of persons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">BEHIND THE SCENES</span></h2>
<p>For a moment Dorothy felt as if she must make
her way back after her friends&mdash;it was so terrifying
to find herself in such a press&mdash;but a glance at
the wavering canvas that now hid from the public
the company of players and helpers, inspired her
with new courage. She would go behind the
scenes and see if that girl was Tavia!</p>
<p>In a short time the theatre was emptied, save
for the ushers and the boys who dashed in and out
among the rows of seats, picking up the scattered
programmes, and making the place ready for the
evening performance. One of the ushers, seeing
Dorothy, walked over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for anybody?&rdquo; he asked mechanically,
without glancing up at her, but indicating that
he was ready to turn up the seat before which she
was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the company?&rdquo; he inquired next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The young lady who played Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; the young man exclaimed snappily,
but in no unpleasant tone. He led the way
along the row of seats, down an isle and through a
very narrow door that seemed to be made of black
oil cloth.</p>
<p>Dorothy had no time to think of what was going
to happen. It had all come about so quickly&mdash;she
hardly knew how to proceed now&mdash;what
name to ask for&mdash;or whether or not to give her
own in case it was demanded. She wondered
what the actress would think of her if Katherine
did not turn out to be Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Riceman,&rdquo; the usher went on
as he closed the narrow door. &ldquo;This way,
please,&rdquo; and, the next moment, Dorothy found
herself behind the scenes in a big city theatre.</p>
<p>The place was a maze of doors and passageways.
Wires and ropes were in a seeming tangle
overhead and all about were big wooden frames
covered with painted canvas&mdash;scenes and flies that
slid in and out at the two sides of a stage, and
make up a very important part of a theatrical
company&rsquo;s outfit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>These immense canvases seemed to be all over,
and every time Dorothy tried to walk toward a
door indicated by her guide, who had suddenly
disappeared, she found she was in front of or behind
some depiction of a building, or the side of a
house or a street. Mechanics were busy all about
her.</p>
<p>Suddenly a girl thrust her head from one of the
many doors and shouted to an unseen person:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie! Nellie, dear! I&rsquo;m ready for that ice-cream
soda. Get into your street togs quick or
you&rsquo;ll be having soup instead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie! Nellie!&rdquo; came in a chorus from all
sides, though the owners of the voices remained
hidden, and then there rang out through the big
space a spontaneous burst of a line from the chorus
of the old song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I was seeing Nellie home. I was seeing Nellie home.</p>
<p class="t0">It was from Aunt Dinah&rsquo;s quilting party, I was seeing Nellie home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! How&rsquo;s that, Nellie?&rdquo; inquired a
deep bass voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Dorothy stood for a moment, not knowing what
to do. This was better than the play, she thought,
as she vaguely wondered what sort of life must be
led behind the scenes. Then the thought of her
position sent a chill over her. She must seek out
the performer who went by the name of Miss
Riceman, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>By this time a number of the characters appeared
from their dressing rooms, and Dorothy stepped
up to a girl with an enormous hat on her head,
and a pair of very small shoes in her hand. As
the girl sank gracefully down on an upturned box
to adjust her ties, and, incidentally, to get a breath
of air after the atmosphere of the stuffy dressing
room, Dorothy asked timidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where Miss Riceman&rsquo;s dressing
room is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That first door to the left,&rdquo; answered the girl,
tilting her big hat back far enough to allow a
glimpse of her questioner.</p>
<p>Dorothy stepped up to the door. Surely Tavia
could not be there! Dorothy&rsquo;s heart beat furiously.
She was trembling so she could hardly
knock, but managed to give a faint tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; called a girlish voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dale,&rdquo; answered Dorothy mechanically,
feeling as if she would almost be willing to give up
her search for Tavia if she could be well out of the
place. There was a moment&rsquo;s wait and then the
door swung open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; invited the girl from within the
little room. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re Miss&mdash;let me see&mdash;I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ve forgotten your name&mdash;you&rsquo;re
from the <i>Leader</i>, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dorothy, breathing easier, now
that she found herself alone with a girl&mdash;a simple
human being just like any other girl. &ldquo;I am
looking for&mdash;for a friend,&rdquo; she went on, stammeringly,
&ldquo;and I thought perhaps you could tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Riceman
whose toilet was so unceremoniously interrupted
&ldquo;just come in and sit down on this trunk. Then
let me get you something. You actually look ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&mdash;just a little fri&mdash;frightened,&rdquo;
Dorothy gasped, for indeed she was now feeling
queer and dizzy, and it was all getting black before
her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nettie!&rdquo; called the actress, &ldquo;get me some
cold water and call to the girls in the &lsquo;Lair&rsquo; and
see if they have made coffee. Hurry now,&rdquo; to the
woman who helped the actresses dress. Then she
offered Dorothy a bottle of smelling salts.
&ldquo;Take a whiff of that,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;The
woman will be back soon with some ice water.
I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re not well. Was it the smell from
the gas lights? I don&rsquo;t see why they make us poor
actresses put up with them, when they have electric
light in front. It&rsquo;s abominable! And the
smoke from the powder they use to make the
lightning! It fairly chokes me,&rdquo; and she blew
aside a curling wreath of vapor that sifted in
through the door. A moment later the woman
handed in a pitcher of water and a glass. &ldquo;No
coffee?&rdquo; in answer to some message. &ldquo;Well, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress flew over to a box that served as a
dresser and poured out a glass of water for Dorothy.
As she did so Dorothy had a chance to look
at Katherine, whom she imagined might be Tavia.
There was not the slightest resemblance now that
the actress had her &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; off. How could
a little paint, powder and the glare from the footlights
perform such a miracle, thought Dorothy.
This girl was as different from Tavia as Dorothy
was herself. And yet she did look so like her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a nice drink of water,&rdquo; spoke Miss
Riceman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now please don&rsquo;t let me bother you so,&rdquo;
pleaded Dorothy, sitting up determinedly and trying
to look as if nothing was the matter. But she
sipped the water gladly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite well now,
thank you, Miss Riceman, and I&rsquo;ll not detain you a
moment longer from your dressing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child, sit still. You won&rsquo;t bother
me the least bit. I&rsquo;ll go right on. Now tell me
who it is you&rsquo;re looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy watched the actress toss aside a mass
of brown hair that was so like Tavia&rsquo;s. Then
she saw a string pulled and&mdash;the wig came off.
The real, naturally blond hair of Miss Riceman
fell in a shower over her shoulders.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p178.jpg" alt="MISS RICEMAN&rsquo;S HAIR FELL IN A SHOWER OVER HER SHOULDERS" width="500" height="691" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">MISS RICEMAN&rsquo;S HAIR FELL IN A SHOWER OVER HER SHOULDERS</span></p>
</div>
<p>Turning to Dorothy the performer instantly realized
that the scene was new to her visitor and,
with that strange, subtle instinct which seems to
characterize the artistic professional woman, she
at once relieved the situation by remarking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know we never feel like removing our
&lsquo;make-up&rsquo; before the reporters. Even women
representatives of the press (and of course we
never admit any others to our dressing rooms)
have such a funny way of describing things that
I should be mortally afraid of taking off my wig
before one. I thought you were Miss&mdash;Oh,
what&rsquo;s her name&mdash;I never can think of it&mdash;from
the <i>Leader</i>. I expected her to call. But, do you
know that women reporters are just the dearest
set of rascals in the world? They simply can&rsquo;t
help being funny when it&rsquo;s a joke on you. Now,
whom did you say you were looking for? I do
rattle on so!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>All this, of course, was giving Dorothy time&mdash;and
she needed it badly, for her story was by no
means ready for a &ldquo;dress rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was something so self-assuring about
the actress&mdash;she was not in the least coarse or
loud-spoken&mdash;she was, on the contrary, the very
embodiment of politeness. Dorothy felt she
could talk freely with her about Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for a young girl named Octavia
Travers,&rdquo; began Dorothy bravely, &ldquo;and I
thought possibly she might be with this company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she with this company previously? I
don&rsquo;t seem to recall the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that she is with any company,&rdquo;
Dorothy hastened to add, feeling how foolish
it must seem to be looking for a girl in a theatrical
troupe when one had no more assurance
that she might be with such a company than that
she might be working in a department store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you her address?&rdquo; asked Miss Riceman,
as she stood before the glass, daubing on
some cold cream to remove the last of the &ldquo;make-up&rdquo;
from her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dorothy miserably enough.
&ldquo;I only wish I had.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>The actress with the cream jar turned around
in time to see the tears coming into Dorothy&rsquo;s eyes.
Miss Riceman dropped the jar down on her improvised
dresser and came over to where her visitor
sat on the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo; she said kindly, sitting
down beside Dorothy. &ldquo;Perhaps I can help you.
She is not your sister, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer, and then began a confidence
of which Dorothy had scarcely believed
herself capable. She told how Tavia was as much
to her as a sister could be, and how she feared her
chum had taken to the stage on account of her peculiarities
while at school. Then Dorothy described
Tavia&rsquo;s appearance&mdash;how pretty she was&mdash;what
beautiful hair she had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her eyes,&rdquo; Dorothy almost cried, &ldquo;I have
never seen eyes like Tavia&rsquo;s. They are as soft a
brown as the inside of a chestnut burr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; chimed in Miss Riceman. &ldquo;I
would not be surprised but that I saw that very
girl the other day. It was in the manager&rsquo;s office.
She came alone and she looked&mdash;well&mdash;I knew
at once that she was a total stranger to the business.
And when the manager asked how old
she was (for they have to be particular about age
you know) I think she said seventeen, but I knew
she was not quite as old as that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Dorothy clasped her hands in a strained gesture.
How she wanted to find Tavia, yet how she feared
to discover her in this way!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be her,&rdquo; she faltered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was, she is with a company playing on
the same circuit we do,&rdquo; went on Miss Riceman.
&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; and she consulted a slip of paper
pinned to the wall. &ldquo;Yes, they follow us in some
towns. It was the &lsquo;Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s Secret&rsquo;
company that the girl I am speaking about applied
to, and I&rsquo;m sure she was engaged, for I was interested
in her appearance, and later I asked some
one about her. Now the thing for you to do is to
come to the manager&rsquo;s office here to-morrow afternoon,
between five and six. He has control of
several companies, including the one I&rsquo;m with and
the L. R. S. as we call it for short, the &lsquo;Lady
Rossmore&rsquo;s Secret&rsquo; I mean. Just ask him for
your friend&rsquo;s address&mdash;or, better still, just ask
where the company is playing and she&rsquo;ll be sure to
be with it. He might not pay much attention to
you if he thought you were looking for some one
in particular and hadn&rsquo;t any clue to her whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Dorothy determinedly, as she
arose to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t leave here until you are positive
you feel all right,&rdquo; cautioned Miss Riceman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very glad to have met you and I
hope I have been able to help you. I&rsquo;m sorry I
can&rsquo;t tell you where the Rossmore company is,
but I haven&rsquo;t made a memoranda of the complete
booking as I sometimes do. I thought I had it on
a slip of paper but I find I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve helped me a lot,&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy, hardly able to put her gratitude
into words, but the busy little actress looked entirely
satisfied with her visitor&rsquo;s thanks as she
showed Dorothy the way out of the stage door.
She smiled cheerily at her as she waved her hand
in good-bye and then she went back behind the
scenes again, to her dressing room to resume the
removal of the &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; from her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE CLUE</span></h2>
<p>Outside the door Dorothy again felt that girlish
inclination to collapse. What excuse could
she make to her friends for her delay? How
would she get back to them? Perhaps they were
looking all over the city for her and they might
have even notified the police of her absence.</p>
<p>All the novelty of the theatre that had, for the
past half hour, put a world between Dorothy and
those outside of the stage dressing rooms, was now
dispelled. What would she say or do when she
met Rose-Mary? How could she now conceal
her worry and anxiety? How was she to continue
her search for Tavia?</p>
<p>The stage door opened into a dismal, narrow
alley. Here Dorothy found herself in the midst
of a scurrying crowd of working people, for several
large factories had just shut down. The girl
stood for a moment and looked helplessly about
her. Presently she felt an arm on her shoulder
and started in alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice, and she turned
to see Nat standing beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nat! I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. Just step along this way. I knew
you hadn&rsquo;t come out the front way so I came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy pressed her shoulder against her cousin
in a helpless, imploring sort of way. He seemed
to know what the action meant for instantly he had
ready to recite, a most plausible explanation of her
disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got left behind and were frightened,&rdquo; he
asked and answered in same breath. &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;I
told &rsquo;em all so. Then some of the ushers
took you back and let you out of the stage door.
Silly, to get alarmed over a little thing like that.
But I couldn&rsquo;t talk to Mrs. Markin&mdash;she was almost
in hysterics. We&rsquo;d better hurry back to relieve
her suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not have delayed talking, but really
I was so&mdash;so frightened,&rdquo; ventured Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cert you were. Well, you just let me tell the
story. It will save lots of trouble, but of course
the girls will have to know all about the people
you met&mdash;behind the scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Was ever there such a blessed boy as Nat?
Here he had nicely explained all Dorothy&rsquo;s troubles
and in the simplest manner possible. How
splendid boy cousins are, thought Dorothy. They
have such a power of sympathy for girls&mdash;better
than brothers&mdash;if girls would only allow them to
exercise it&mdash;in a cousinly way.</p>
<p>Or did Nat know of Dorothy&rsquo;s deliberate visit
to the little actress who had played Katherine?
Perhaps some one had told him his cousin was in
the dressing room and he had just waited for her
to appear at the stage door. Dorothy was sure
Nat would save her from making any troublesome
explanations, and when he asked her, in the most
matter-of-fact way if she happened to meet the girl
with the brown hair who looked so much like Tavia,
she had no hesitation in telling him that she
was Miss Riceman, and that she was a most charming
young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look a bit like Tavia&mdash;close by,&rdquo;
added Dorothy, remembering the scene in the
dressing room. &ldquo;She is as refined and polite as
possible. She showed me the way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After telling that much of her adventure to Nat,
Dorothy was well prepared to repeat the story to
the others, without fear of disclosing the real object
of her visit behind the scenes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>When Mrs. Markin was finally assured of Dorothy&rsquo;s
safety, and had actually listened with interest
to her recital of the trip into stageland, and her
encounters there, the matter was regarded as an
incident fraught with untold curious bits of &ldquo;real
live adventure.&rdquo; Girls do delight in investigating
and exploring the unusual quite as much as boys
do, although the latter are prone to attribute that
faculty to themselves as something patented.</p>
<p>So it happens that when a girl does actually
have an experience she and her companions know
how to appreciate the novelty. That was how it
turned out with Dorothy and her friends. Rose-Mary
and Alma couldn&rsquo;t hear enough of &ldquo;behind
the scenes&rdquo; and Alma ventured to ask Dorothy
to take them in through the stage door to make a
second call on Miss Riceman, when she might introduce
her friends to a real actress.</p>
<p>But Dorothy tried to appease their curiosity as
best she could, telling over and over again how she
got lost in the crowd, how the usher accosted her,
and led her to the stage, and then how she got confused
in her effort to find the &ldquo;right door&rdquo;
(which was all true enough) and how it was then
that Miss Riceman came out and invited Dorothy
in. Then she related how she became faint and
told of the water being brought, and so on, until
the very closing of the stage door after her when
she found herself in the alley with Nat at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>But now Dorothy was about to enter upon a
delicate and what might prove to be a difficult adventure.
She had to go to the manager&rsquo;s office
the next afternoon, but beyond that point, she
dared not trust herself to think or plan. When
night came, and all seemed to be asleep Dorothy,
in her room in the big hotel, had a chance to look
the situation squarely in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thought I must keep before me,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;I am bound to find Tavia and save
her. To do this I will have to take great risks,
and perhaps be very much misunderstood, but I
must do it. Her risk is even greater than mine
and if I appear to deceive people&mdash;even dear,
good, thoughtful Nat,&mdash;I must do so to continue
my search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl, with aching head, planned how
she could get away to see the theatrical manager
the next day. She would not pretend to have
any plans made for going out, and then, just before
the hour Miss Riceman had told her the manager&rsquo;s
office would be open, she would announce
that she wanted to get some souvenirs of Buffalo
to take home with her. This, she decided, would
give her an opportunity to hurry away alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>But, oh, how she dreaded to face that manager!
If it were only a woman who was in charge of the
office, but a man! And she had heard vague
stories of how dreadfully rude some managers
were to persons who bothered them. There were
so many questions she would have to ask&mdash;enough
to put any manager into bad humor she thought&mdash;and
perhaps there would be young girls there like
Tavia looking for engagements&mdash;they would
overhear what she had to say. Oh, it was dreadful,
the more she thought of it!</p>
<p>Dorothy buried her head deeper into the pillow
and tried to sleep. She felt that she must get some
rest or she would not be able to carry on the work
that demanded so much of her strength, her brains
and her courage. She needed them all now to follow
up the clue of Tavia&rsquo;s whereabouts given by
Miss Riceman.</p>
<p>It was almost morning when Dorothy fell into
an unquiet sleep, and it was glaring daylight, with
the sun streaming into her window, when she
awoke. Rose-Mary was moving about the room
on tip-toe after some things, feeling the necessity
of allowing Dorothy all possible rest, as she had
appeared so exhausted after her experience of the
previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry you are going away to-morrow,&rdquo;
spoke Rose-Mary, seeing that Dorothy was awake.
&ldquo;This is the last day we will have together for
some time. I have enjoyed your visit so much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been rather stupid,&rdquo; apologized
Dorothy, feeling as if she must make some
excuse for her seeming indifference to Rose-Mary&rsquo;s
entertainment. &ldquo;But, Cologne dear, I can never
tell you how grateful I am for this chance to see
Buffalo. It seems as if I had really entered a new
world since I came into this big city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed everything, dear,&rdquo;
said Rose-Mary. &ldquo;But you must rest to-day and
not go sight-seeing any more. You will need to be
fresh for your auto trip to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll rest to-day,&rdquo; replied Dorothy, as
she slipped into her dressing-gown and approached
the dresser. There she found a dainty array of
remembrances Cologne had selected for her to take
home. This was a surprise and it told Dorothy
more plainly than words could, that Rose-Mary
loved her, and so loved to make her happy.</p>
<p>There were some exquisite bits of undecorated
china for Dorothy to add to her collection of hand-painted
pieces, there was a &ldquo;darling&rdquo; little traveling
mirror from Mrs. Markin, and Jack, who
would not be left out in spite of his sister&rsquo;s protestations
that a strange young man could not give
a young lady a present even if it was a sort of
souvenir of Buffalo, had made Rose-Mary place
on the table with the other tokens a cute little
pocket camera. He secretly hoped his sister
would just hint to Dorothy that he had selected it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Such an array quite overpowered Dorothy and
she threw her arms about Rose-Mary&rsquo;s neck and
cried as if her heart would break.</p>
<p>She calmed down after a while, but even when
she and Rose-Mary were dressed the two had little
spells of weeping at the thought of parting.
Jack peeped in at the door, but when he saw his
sister and Dorothy in an embrace, with tears in
their eyes, he hurried away, muttering something
about &ldquo;fool girls crying when they&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; and
he &ldquo;guessed he wouldn&rsquo;t hang around to spoil
their fun, if that was what they called a merry
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two girls were left to themselves to exchange
confidences and talk over their fall meeting
at Glenwood when school should begin again.</p>
<p>Time managed to slip around quickly that day,
and, when afternoon came, Dorothy began to
get nervous about her prospective visit to the manager&rsquo;s
office. It would surely seem rude to leave
Rose-Mary alone, but nothing must deter her from
carrying out her plan&mdash;no, not even the displeasure
of her friends, and this was no small matter
to Dorothy when she faced it&mdash;she who made
such firm friendships when she did make them,
and who was always an example of good breeding
and politeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>When her valise had been packed, so that the
entire evening might be left for pleasure, and Nat
and Ned had appeared from their quarters to make
final arrangements about coming for Dorothy
directly after breakfast, she glanced at her watch
and found it lacked just half an hour of five
o&rsquo;clock! The boys were engaged in an argument
with Rose-Mary, as to the relative beauty of Boston
and New York, Ned holding that a Battery
and a Bowery made New York the winner.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dorothy jumped up from the porch
chair where she had been sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll just run down town to get some
more souvenir postal cards,&rdquo; she said bravely, as
she started to leave the veranda. She had her
purse in her hand, and there was no need to wear
a hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Cologne in natural surprise.
&ldquo;I thought you had plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat saw the flush of color that came into Dorothy&rsquo;s
cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m with you!&rdquo; he declared, getting up
from his place and assisting his cousin down the
steps. &ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;Do the
best you can, Ned. I&rsquo;ll be back directly. Just
want to make sure that Doro doesn&rsquo;t fall by the
wayside again,&rdquo; and at that the two cousins
bolted off laughing, Dorothy having recovered
her composure when she saw how quickly Nat
came to her relief. Ned and Rose-Mary were
taken so by surprise at the sudden move that they
seemed dazed, and the look on their faces at the
bolt of the two only made the departing ones
more merry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; said Dorothy as they turned the corner,
&ldquo;I really wanted to go to some place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead then,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;only, Doro,
you know Ned and I are responsible for you and
you had best tell me about it. You know I won&rsquo;t
interfere&mdash;only to be sure it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat, you are such a good cousin,&rdquo; began
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; echoed Nat. &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t say
so? Make a note of that and tell the others&mdash;they
would never believe me. There, did you
see that streak of sunshine stick to my brow? It
was a halo, sure thing. But, I say, what are you
going to do, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look for Tavia,&rdquo; replied Dorothy miserably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought so. But where is the looking to be
done this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would inquire at the office of the
theatre. They might happen to know something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, come along. I&rsquo;ll wait outside.
Theatre people, especially managers and those in
the office, are usually very busy and won&rsquo;t keep
you long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with all possible kindness, but,
somehow, it gave Dorothy a cold chill. She was
so afraid of facing the manager. Oh, if she
only could let Nat go in with her! But that
would not be fair to Tavia, whose secret, if she
ever discovered it, she determined to keep inviolate.
She must do it alone, and do it secretly
to save Tavia from the possible consequences of
her folly, should it turn out that she really was
with a company &ldquo;on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more block and Nat and Dorothy were in
front of the theatre where they had attended the
play the day before. They stood before the great
open lobby, empty now save for a few workmen
who were busy with mops scrubbing the tiled
marble floor. Nat took Dorothy&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the office of the manager, right over
there,&rdquo; he said, indicating a small door that bore
no mark to distinguish it from many others that
opened from the foyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for you.
Now, don&rsquo;t be afraid to push yourself up front if
there&rsquo;s a crowd waiting for him. We haven&rsquo;t
any too much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all the courage that Dorothy could summon
to her aid she walked up to the little door,
opened it and stepped inside a little ante-room.
She was in the manager&rsquo;s office, and the presence
of several other persons, who turned to stare at
her did not serve to put her at her ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">DOROTHY AND THE MANAGER</span></h2>
<p>Dorothy sank into a chair near the door.
Two or three important-looking women were
moving about restlessly, awaiting their turn to
pass beyond the portal guarded by a stout youth,
and face the manager in his private rooms. Others,
younger and more timid, sat quite still in their
chairs, as did Dorothy, and the girl could imagine
that they were silently praying for success in the
prospective interview with one who might decide
their fate. Dorothy seemed beyond thinking
consistently about her own circumstances; she just
sat there and waited. The youth at the door of
the private office looked at her sharply. Doubtless
he was wondering whether she had an appointment,
or whether she was one to be allowed to
enter out of her turn because of some &ldquo;pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Dorothy that the very place rang
with an appeal for place, for position&mdash;for opportunity,
although not a word was spoken. But
the look on the faces of those waiting spoke louder
than words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Finally a girl in a red hat went in and came out
so quickly that the others looked at her curiously.
She murmured something that showed she had
been treated with scant ceremony. Then a very
stout woman, wearing an enormous veil brushed
past Dorothy. She was not escorted in by the
boy, but dashed past him as the girl in red came
out. Then, when the woman with the excess of
avoirdupois came out, the boy stepped up to
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; he said kindly. Then it occurred
to Dorothy that every one so far had been
kind to her. Were these people, that others had
spoken of so slightingly, not all respectful and
polite to any one who seemed to merit such consideration?
She felt that they were not half as
black as they had been painted.</p>
<p>The next moment the anxious girl was in the
private office of the manager. It was a small
room, but not gloomy in spite of the fact that it
was in the midst of a darkened theatre. A fine
rug was on the floor and there were a few well-chosen
pictures on the walls, the electric lights
showing them off to advantage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>While the manager, who sat in a big revolving
chair, looked over some papers on his desk before
turning to Dorothy, she had an opportunity to
see that there hung before him what were evidently
family photographs. One was of a little
girl and another of a youth. Surely, she thought,
a man who had time to look at his children&rsquo;s pictures
during business hours could not be so very
harsh because his time was taken up by a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the manager suddenly as he
wheeled around in his chair, wiping his glasses
carefully but not seeming to look at Dorothy.</p>
<p>She caught her breath with a gasp. The moment
had come. Her heart was beating painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I came to&mdash;to ask if you&mdash;if you have
on your books the name of a young lady&mdash;Miss
Octavia Travers?&rdquo; she managed to stammer out.
&ldquo;A young lady with the &lsquo;Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s
Secret&rsquo; company, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travers,&rdquo; repeated the manager thoughtfully,
&ldquo;Travers? Seems to me I have. Is she
your sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but I have always regarded her
as such&mdash;we have been very close friends all our
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very long time at that,&rdquo; remarked the
manager with a smile. &ldquo;But what is it you want
to know about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get her address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, I&rsquo;ll look it up&mdash;but if she is
such a close friend of yours why didn&rsquo;t she send
you her address? She knew where she was going
to be,&rdquo; and he spoke pointedly.</p>
<p>Tears welled into Dorothy&rsquo;s eyes, and she felt
that she could not trust herself to speak. The
manager looked critically at her. Then he laid
aside the book he had picked up to consult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/front.jpg" alt="&ldquo;RUN AWAY?&rdquo; HE ASKED" width="500" height="777" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;RUN AWAY?&rdquo; HE ASKED</span></p>
</div>
<p>Dorothy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t feel so badly about it, my girl.
We&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t find her for you. But first
you had better tell me the story. It will help
greatly. You see when we engage a girl and she
happens to prove satisfactory we have no excuse
for dismissing her unless she might be under age&mdash;and
then her parents&mdash;of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must keep the entire matter from her
parents,&rdquo; interrupted Dorothy. &ldquo;I must find
Tavia myself and I know when I do she will listen
to me and it will be all right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy was visibly trembling. The manager
folded his arms and looked at her thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a young girl to undertake this,&rdquo;
he said finally. &ldquo;But I like your spirit, and I&rsquo;m
going to help you. I tell you, my child, the stage
is no place for a young person who has had no
experience with the ways of the world. I never
encourage a young girl to go on the stage. There
are plenty of older characters whom we can get
and then there is less danger. But this girl you
are looking for&mdash;was she about your height?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with very brown hair,&rdquo; replied Dorothy.
&ldquo;And such lovely light brown eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; and he consulted the book again.
Dorothy waited anxiously, as he turned page after
page. Then he stopped. &ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Christina Travers. That must be the
girl. They rarely give the name just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she might say Christina,&rdquo; admitted
Dorothy. &ldquo;The girls at school called her
&lsquo;Chris&rsquo; for short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is with the &lsquo;L. R. S.&rsquo; company&mdash;I
beg your pardon, I mean the &lsquo;Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s
Secret&rsquo; company. We get in the habit of abbreviating
it. It&rsquo;s a light thing we put on for a
filler. I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t doing any too well,
which, however, may make it easier for you to
induce your friend to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope I can!&rdquo; and Dorothy left her
seat and came to stand beside the manager&rsquo;s desk.
She had lost nearly all her fear and nervousness
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They play in Rochester to-night,&rdquo; went on
the manager consulting his list. &ldquo;Then they go
to Rockdale&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one night in Rochester?&rdquo; asked Dorothy,
showing some surprise and disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one night of that I fancy will be enough
for any place,&rdquo; was the manager&rsquo;s laughing reply.
&ldquo;However, they may stay over to-morrow. But
Rockdale is only a few miles from there. You
could easily catch them at Rockdale. Is there
anything more I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; and Dorothy turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can now, or later, just let me know,&rdquo;
went on the manager. Then he wished her good-bye
and turned back to his desk.</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed when she stepped
up to Nat in the lobby where he was watching
the men putting in place the photographs of
the next week&rsquo;s performers. He seemed to have
forgotten all about his cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that you?&rdquo; he asked, and he looked
like some one suddenly awakened from a dream.
&ldquo;I do believe if I stood here much longer I&rsquo;d be
put into a frame by mistake. How did you make
out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; answered Dorothy pleasantly.
&ldquo;You see I can&rsquo;t quite report on it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. I was only wondering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t wonder. You agreed to act
as my escort and so you must be content with that.
I can only tell you that I am perfectly satisfied
with the interview I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that our little friend Tavia is
not with any company. Well, I&rsquo;m glad of it.
I always did give her credit for having better
sense. But you see, Doro, you are such a romancer
that you sometimes make stories out of
dreams. But I must say you do look ten years
younger. That manager must have been a nice
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; answered Dorothy, glad that Nat,
as usual, had jumped to a conclusion and decided
the matter of the interview for himself, leaving
her free to go on without contradicting or making
any explanations. It was so much better
under the circumstances, she thought, that not
even Nat should know the truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>But just how she was going to carry out the
remainder of her task secretly she could not quite
determine. However, she had now become accustomed
to doing each part as it presented itself,
without planning further into the future, and, in
that manner, she hoped to be able to proceed until
the last link in the chain of her search had been
completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get the souvenir cards,&rdquo; Nat reminded
her, as they came to a store with the pretty-pictured
varieties in the window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just buy
a pack of mixed ones&mdash;it will save time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dorothy was not thinking of souvenir
cards. Thoughts came to her of the play at
Rochester, with Tavia as one of the characters&mdash;Tavia
who must be timid amid her new and
unaccustomed surroundings in spite of her apparent
recklessness&mdash;yes, Tavia would be much
frightened at what she had done, Dorothy was
sure of it, when the girl, so far away from home
and friends found herself before a critical audience
in a theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only reach her before another
night,&rdquo; Dorothy thought, &ldquo;but how can it be
managed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys would start for home to-morrow,
and of course Dorothy would have to go with
them. Something would surely happen&mdash;<i>must</i>
surely happen before then to help her, Dorothy
thought, with a confidence which great emergencies
sometimes inspire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Nat, as he made
his way out of the post-card store, &ldquo;if you were
to send one of these particularly bright red ones
to Tavia at Dalton she would send one back on
the next mail, wishing you a merry Christmas, for
all your trouble. What do you suppose she would
say if she knew of the merry chase that had been
going on after her, and all the places you have
been looking for her? And all the while she was
as safe as little Bo-peep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t intend to send her any cards until
she writes me first,&rdquo; answered Dorothy. &ldquo;She
owes me an apology for not writing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Nat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll treat her the
same way. The saucy little thing,&rdquo; he added
facetiously, &ldquo;not to answer our nice long letters.
She ought to be slapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy laughed at her cousin&rsquo;s good humor.
It was better that he should take this view of the
case than that he should suspect the real facts.
Dorothy glanced at some of the cards as they hurried
along back to the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; pointed out Nat, &ldquo;that
would just suit the circumstances. A girl doing
a song and a smile&mdash;that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;turn&rsquo; Tavia has
been doing to you, Doro. We must save that one
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dorothy abstractedly, taking
the card in her hand. It was the picture of a girl
in chorus costume, and was enscribed with an appropriate
verse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; explained Nat, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got
everything down to a post-card basis now. That
one is intended to be used in place of making a
party call when a gentleman has blown a girl to
a theatrical good time. She just sends this card
back and that suffices for formal thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it might not just suit our set,&rdquo; he
conceded, &ldquo;but for those in the post-card clientele
it&rsquo;s a cinch, as the poet says. I tell you after a
while we will be able to carry on all our business
correspondence with picture postals and not be
under the necessity of writing a word. Great
scheme, Nat (patting himself on the left shoulder
with his right hand), get a patent on your new
post-card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had now reached the hotel. The veranda
was deserted as the hour for dinner was almost at
hand and the guests were dressing. Nat left
Dorothy at the elevator, with a warning to be
ready early in the morning. Then he hurried
to where he and Ned were staying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">ADRIFT IN A STRANGE CITY</span></h2>
<p>In spite of Dorothy&rsquo;s courage, and her efforts
to keep each of her troubles apart, that she might
meet and cope with them singly, the time had now
come when she found herself sorely puzzled.</p>
<p>How would she be able to reach Rochester&mdash;to
leave her cousins and proceed alone in her
search for Tavia?</p>
<p>The morning of departure dawned bright and
clear, conditions most necessary for a pleasant
automobile trip, and when the Markin family
waved an affectionate adieu, the Fire Bird puffed
away from in front of the hotel, Rose-Mary
throwing innumerable kisses to Dorothy. Suddenly,
as they swung into the street, Dorothy
turned to Ned and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned, could you let me go part of the way
home, by train? I did not want to mention it at
the hotel as Mrs. Markin would be sure to worry,
but I would so like to return by rail. You could
just leave me at the depot and then&mdash;you might
stop for me at&mdash;did you say you were going
through Rochester on your way back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Ned and Nat gazed at their cousin in surprise.
What could she mean to ask to leave them and
go to North Birchland alone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you think it strange,&rdquo; she hastened
to add, &ldquo;but really you know, I am able to travel
alone that short distance. You know I came
from Glenwood alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Nat, &ldquo;but this
time mother put you in our charge and these are
big cities around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the auto makes you feel ill,&rdquo; put in
Nat, &ldquo;of course no one could object to you going
by train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would so much rather,&rdquo; declared Dorothy,
taking advantage of Nat&rsquo;s ready excuse for her.
&ldquo;I have found that there is a train at eight-thirty.
Then, if you pass through Rochester, you could
meet me there. I can go to some young women&rsquo;s
club and wait if I do not meet you exactly on
time at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a brave stroke, and Dorothy felt that
she would not be equal to further argument should
the boys offer much more opposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean for us to leave you here at the
Buffalo depot?&rdquo; asked Ned in a dazed sort of
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have plenty of money with me, and I
know perfectly well how to travel alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may have to change cars, and suppose
you were to be left alone in Rochester in case we
had a breakdown and couldn&rsquo;t pick you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any worse staying in Rochester
than it would in some place near where you happened
to have the accident. I hope you don&rsquo;t
have any. But I have told you what I would do
in case you didn&rsquo;t call for me. I&rsquo;d stay at some
girls&rsquo; club. There are plenty of them in Rochester
I&rsquo;ve read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Ned. &ldquo;I suppose you
ought to know what you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the station,&rdquo; exclaimed Nat. &ldquo;What
time did you say the train left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-thirty,&rdquo; replied Dorothy. &ldquo;We have
plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when she realized that she was to be left
alone, to go in a train to that strange, big city,
she felt as if she must cry out against the circumstances
that forced her to all this trouble. Why
should she deceive her two kind cousins, and desert
them to take that risky journey alone? And
she did believe her prospective trip dangerous in
spite of her assertions to the contrary. It was
very different to making the journey to Glenwood
when she had had Tavia with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Besides, going into the New England mountains
was along a quiet way, while this trip&mdash;she
dared not trust herself to think further. She
must decide at once, and she must go&mdash;alone
to look for Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a Pullman ticket,&rdquo; Ned said
rather gloomily, as the auto dashed up to the station,
&ldquo;but I do wish, Doro, that you would come
on with us. Of course, in the parlor car you will
be quite safe, and can rest better than in the Fire
Bird. I&rsquo;ll see the porter and have him look after
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ned,&rdquo; Dorothy managed to reply,
and, but for his haste to make arrangements
for her comfort, the youth would have seen tears
in his cousin&rsquo;s eyes, and noticed that her hands
trembled as Nat helped her out of the machine to
the station platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, after all, it will be better for you to
go straight on to North Birchland,&rdquo; she said, trying
to make her voice sound easy and natural, but
conscious that her tones were rather unsteady.
She was now putting into operation the second
part of her plan. &ldquo;It might be risky to attempt
to pick me up in Rochester. I might miss you or
you might miss me, whereas if we both follow out
our route separately we will be sure to get to the
Cedars in safety and without any delay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you have decided to desert us, and
travel by train, leaving the poor old Fire Bird
to struggle along as best it can without a lady
passenger, perhaps it will be best,&rdquo; Nat agreed,
in a dazed sort of way. He seemed for a time
quite unlike Nat White&mdash;quite different from
the youth who was always ready to take up the
weak end of an argument and carry it to the
strongest point of conclusion. Here he was letting
his favorite cousin start away alone on a
train to a strange big city, when she had been
entrusted to his care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Doro,&rdquo; called Ned, coming
from the depot where he had hurried as soon as
the auto stopped. &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; and he thrust
some bills into her hands, as well as her tickets.
&ldquo;And do, above everything else, be careful.
I&rsquo;ve seen the porter, and tipped him so he will
look after you. Now, you&rsquo;d better get in and
we&rsquo;ll leave you, as we want to make good time.
Good-bye,&rdquo; and he stooped to kiss the pale-faced
girl who was now too overcome with emotion to
trust her own voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Nat put his arm affectionately around her and
he, too, gave her a farewell kiss. They walked
with her to the waiting train, and then the porter,
in his blue uniform, adorned with numerous brass
buttons, helped her aboard the car &ldquo;Seneca.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">IN DIRE DISTRESS</span></h2>
<p>Dorothy had traveled in parlor cars before
but had never ridden in a sleeper, which was the
style of coach she now found herself in. The
train was a through one from the west and, as
the regular parlor cars were full Ned had to get a
ticket in the sleeper which, by day, is much the
same as a parlor car.</p>
<p>As the porter set her valise down and arranged
a seat for her near the ladies&rsquo; retiring room Dorothy&rsquo;s
heart beat fast, and, though the surroundings
were new and novel to her she took no interest
in them. But as the train whistled off, and the
other passengers began moving about, Dorothy
lifted her head and glanced around.</p>
<p>For a moment she felt that some mistake had
been made. Surely this was no train for ladies,
for not a woman was in sight, instead the entire
car seemed filled with men in various stages of incomplete
toilets. Some were adjusting their neckties
as they walked through the aisle, others were
fastening shoe laces, and a few buckling their belts
or slipping on their coats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Then she noticed, for the first time, that the
car was a sleeper, for the interior was so dark because
of the train shed when she entered that she
could not tell what it was. She saw the berths
on both sides, with heavy curtains lining the aisle.
Only one or two beds had been shut up and turned
into seats like the one she was occupying.</p>
<p>Dorothy was annoyed. Was she to make her
lonely trip in company with a car full of men?
She had expected, when she planned her journey,
that there would be other girls and ladies in the
coach in which she was to travel, and that she
might appeal to them in case of need. But a
whole car full of men!</p>
<p>She looked about for the little electric call button,
and, finding it in the casement at the side of
the window, pressed it vigorously. It was some
time before the porter responded as, all along his
route, the omnipresent men claimed his attention
for various services. But finally he reached the
end of the car where the girl in the blue sailor suit
sat up very prim and stiff, waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this&mdash;er&mdash;a ladies&rsquo; car?&rdquo; she asked timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A ladies&rsquo; car? Oh, yes, miss. This is all
right. This is the car for Rochester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;never was in a car like&mdash;like this
before,&rdquo; Dorothy objected, glancing about at the
men who were still struggling in the aisles with
various refractory articles of clothing.</p>
<p>For a moment the porter seemed puzzled.
Then, all at once, he understood Dorothy&rsquo;s objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them&rsquo;s only the gentlemen gettin&rsquo; ready
to leave, miss. They&rsquo;ll all be out soon, and you&rsquo;ll
have more room. Anything I can do for you,
miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Dorothy just checked herself from
adding &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; which she felt would not be
quite proper, and would show that she was unused
to the attention of a porter. Then the colored attendant
made his way down the aisle, while the
only girl in the car held her face close against the
window pane and fell to thinking of the task that
lay before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>She was not now troubled about the car and the
occupants. If it was all right, and she would be
brought safely to Rochester in it, that was all she
had to consider. Of course it would have been
less lonely to have had the usual day coach passengers
with her, but she thought Ned must have selected
this car and she felt he knew best. Then,
too, the porter had said the men were rapidly leaving
their berths and as soon as they did so the colored
man made the folding beds into broad velvet
seats, similar to the one occupied by Dorothy.</p>
<p>When these seats had replaced the hanging curtains,
and the comfortable places were occupied
by the men who had been so lately sleeping, even
though there were no women among them, Dorothy
recovered from her first shock of embarrassment.
The passengers all appeared to be gentlemen
and not one of them seemed to even glance in
her direction, though they must have realized how
strange it was for a pretty girl to be the lone female
passenger.</p>
<p>When the spasm of brushing clothes into which
the porter threw himself, was finally over, which
operation Dorothy could not help watching for it
was done with such dispatch, and when the men
had gone to the dining car for breakfast or become
engrossed in their newspapers, she tried to map
out her day&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will get off at Rochester,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll inquire for the Criterion Theatre.&rdquo;
She looked at the slip of paper which she carried
so carefully in the little brown leather wrist bag.
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;if the company has left
Rochester I will go to Rockdale. But if it should
get dark!&rdquo; she cried in a low wail of terror. &ldquo;If
it should get dark and I should be all alone in a
strange city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the thought of the folks at home and
how they would worry if night came on and she
did not reach them. Was ever a girl so situated?</p>
<p>All sorts of dangers flashed before her mind,
and now, though too late, she realized sharply how
unfit a young girl is to cope with a big, strange
world, how little the world cares for a girl&rsquo;s tender
feelings, and how cold and heartless it is when
she tries to make her way through the city streets
alone, yet crowded on every side by a throng of
other human beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Tavia had to go through it,&rdquo; concluded
Dorothy, &ldquo;and I must not be less brave than was
she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train was somewhat delayed on the run
from Buffalo to Rochester, so it was almost noon
when Dorothy reached the latter city.</p>
<p>On a slip of paper she had the directions of the
theatre she wished to visit, and at the ticket station
learned where the building was located. Then
off she started, with never a look at the shop windows
filled with wonderful displays of all kinds.
She soon found the amusement resort, and stepping
into the lobby, approached the ticket window
and asked timidly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where the &lsquo;Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s
Secret&rsquo; company is playing to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at her sharply. Then he
smiled so ironically that Dorothy&rsquo;s heart gave a
painful thump, and a great lump came into her
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s Secret&rsquo; company,&rdquo; he repeated,
with the most prolonged and distracting
drawl. &ldquo;I guess there isn&rsquo;t any. It&rsquo;s down and
out. Didn&rsquo;t play to a house here last night big
enough to pay the gas bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the members of the company?&rdquo; asked
Dorothy with a choke in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! How should I know?&rdquo; he asked
with a sneer. &ldquo;In jail, maybe, for not paying
their board bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Dorothy felt that she must cry
out and tell him that the matter was very vital to
her&mdash;that she must find a young and friendless
girl who was a member of the company; but she
realized what sort of a man he was and her better
judgment asserted itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But are there any members of the company
in this city?&rdquo; she persisted bravely, trying to keep
up her courage, so as to get a clue as to the whereabouts
of Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this city?&rdquo; he repeated with the same distracting
drawl. &ldquo;Well, no. They managed to
get out of here before the sheriff could attach their
baggage and the scenery, which he was ready to
do. They certainly were as poor a company as
we ever had in this theatre. It was awful. Oh,
no, they didn&rsquo;t dare stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rockdale was their next booked place, but
maybe they didn&rsquo;t dare go there, for fear some
word had been sent on ahead,&rdquo; the ticket seller
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get to Rockdale?&rdquo; asked the girl,
trying to keep back her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get there on a train, of course,&rdquo; and the man
turned back to the paper he had been reading when
Dorothy came in. Perhaps he was angry because
she had not purchased a ticket to the current attraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would be&mdash;be kind enough to direct
me,&rdquo; pleaded Dorothy. &ldquo;I am a stranger here,
and I must find a&mdash;a young girl who is with that
company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Something in her voice and manner seemed to
touch the rather indifferent man, for he straightened
up in his tall chair and looked squarely and
more kindly at Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it? I didn&rsquo;t know. I have
a lot of silly girls always asking about traveling
companies after they&rsquo;ve left here, and I thought
you might be one of them. Now you&rsquo;re talking.
Yes, of course, certainly. If you&rsquo;ve got to find
anybody connected with that company you&rsquo;d better
be quick about it, for I should think there wouldn&rsquo;t
be much left of &rsquo;em by this time. I heard they had
quite a time of it getting their trunks away from
here. Held up for board, you know. But of
course they&rsquo;re used to that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy took hold of the brass rail in front of
her as she turned away from the window. She
felt as if she could hardly stand any more of the
man&rsquo;s veiled insinuations. But it might not be
true&mdash;surely it could not be true&mdash;it was only
his cruel, teasing way. Tavia could not be in such
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get there?&rdquo; Dorothy repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to get to Rockdale,&rdquo; the ticket
seller answered after a pause, &ldquo;you can take the
train at twelve forty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; murmured Dorothy, turning
dizzily toward the street to make her way to the
station she had so recently left. How she managed
to reach the place she never knew. The
great buildings along the way seemed about to
topple over on her head. Her temples were
throbbing and her eyes shot out streaks of flashing
light. Her knees trembled under her. If
only she had time to get something to eat! But
she must not miss that train. It might be the last
one that day.</p>
<p>Through the crowd of waiting persons she
made her way to the ticket office and purchased
the slip of cardboard that entitled her to a ride.
She learned that the train was late and that she
would have to wait ten minutes. Grateful for
that respite Dorothy turned to the little lunch
counter to get a sandwich, and some coffee. But,
before she had reached the end of the big depot
where refreshments were sold, she suddenly stopped&mdash;some
one had grabbed her skirt.</p>
<p>Turning quickly Dorothy beheld a crouching,
cringing figure, almost crawling so as to hide herself
in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl!&rdquo; cried Dorothy, trying to shake off the
grasp on her skirt. &ldquo;Let me go! What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; whispered the miserable
creature. &ldquo;Look again&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;Urania,
the Gypsy girl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Then beneath the rags and the appearance of
age that seemed, in so short a time to have hidden
the identity of this young girl, Dorothy did recognize
Urania. How wretched&mdash;how forlorn
she was; and even in danger of arrest if she was
seen begging in the depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn away from me, Miss!&rdquo; pleaded
the unfortunate Gypsy girl. &ldquo;Please help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stretched out to Dorothy a dirty, trembling
hand. The gate to the Rockdale train had been
thrown open, and Dorothy felt that the time was
almost up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should go home,&rdquo; she said, dropping a
coin into the outstretched palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I want to go home,&rdquo; cried the girl,
and Dorothy was afraid her voice would attract
attention in the crowd. But the passengers were
too busy rushing for their trains to heed anything
else. &ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; pleaded Urania.
&ldquo;You should take me home,&mdash;it was your fine
cousin&mdash;the boy with the taffy-colored hair&mdash;that
brought me here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Dorothy. &ldquo;How dare you
say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him, then, if it isn&rsquo;t so. And ask him
if he wasn&rsquo;t in this very station an hour ago, looking
for some one&mdash;that red-headed girl, likely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you saw my cousin here
to-day?&rdquo; gasped Dorothy. &ldquo;Come; tell me the
truth and you shall go home&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you home
myself&mdash;only tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;Well,
him and his brother came in here an hour ago.
They asked the man at the window if he had seen
a young girl with a brown hand bag. I stood
near to listen, but kept out of sight. Then they
dashed off again before I could ask them for a
penny, or throw it up to that dandy that it was the
ride he gave me in the auto that brought me to
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy, much
shocked. &ldquo;Do you want to go back to the camp
where your people are?&rdquo; She was too dumfounded
at the news to argue with the wild
creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, yes, back to the camp!&rdquo; and Urania&rsquo;s
eyes flashed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take me back.
Even Melea would not turn me out now for I am
sick and sorrowful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It needed but a glance to see that in this, at
least, the girl spoke truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; ordered Dorothy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of
you. But first I must get something to eat. We
have a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Without heeding the attention she attracted by
almost dragging the beggar girl up to the lunch
counter, Dorothy made her way there and ordered
coffee and sandwiches for both. She hurriedly
disposed of her own share, being only a little behind
Urania, who ate as though famished. Then,
hastily procuring another ticket, she bolted
through the door, followed by the Gypsy, who
seemed to take it all as a matter of course.</p>
<p>The ride was, for the most part, a silent one.
Dorothy was busy with her thoughts, and the
Gypsy girl was almost afraid to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will see me to my home&mdash;to the
camp?&rdquo; she pleaded once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dorothy. &ldquo;But you must
have patience&mdash;I have something more important
to attend to first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can wait,&rdquo; answered the little Gypsy.</p>
<p>The Rockdale station was a brick structure,
with a modest waiting-room for women passengers
at the far end. It was there that Dorothy
took Urania as they left the train which steamed
away into the distance. The room was without a
single occupant, a matter of rejoicing to Dorothy,
as she had already experienced considerable difficulty
in passing with Urania through the ordinary
marts of travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you stay here,&rdquo; she told the Gypsy girl,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go out and get you something. You
must be sure to stay in this corner, and eat carefully
so as not to make crumbs. If the station
agent should speak to you while I&rsquo;m gone, just tell
him you are waiting for&mdash;for a lady, who
told you not to leave this room until she returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willingly enough Urania sank down on a corner
of the bench, and tried to smile her thanks at
Dorothy. But Dorothy was too excited to notice
the feeble effort. She hurried to a little store
opposite the station, bought some crackers and
cakes, and after putting the package into the
Gypsy&rsquo;s hands, with another word of caution, was
off again, this time to find the Lyceum Theatre.</p>
<p>It seemed to Dorothy that any place must be
easy to find in a small town, and when she was
directed to the theatre by a man on the street, she
was not surprised to find that it was but a few
blocks from the depot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Hurrying along, she reached a big hall, for the
Lyceum, in spite of its name, was nothing but a
big country hall, with the additional attraction of
iron fire escapes. She knocked at the big broad
wooden door, but soon discovered that the place
was locked up and, evidently, deserted. She made
a number of inquiries of boys she saw nearby, but
all the information she could elicit from the
urchins amounted to nothing more than laughter
and &ldquo;guying&rdquo; to the effect that the company
had come to grief in its attempt to give Rockdale
folks a hint as to what Lady Rossmore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Secret&rdquo;
was. It appeared that the company had arrived
in town, but had at once gotten into legal difficulties
because of some trouble back in Rochester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the members of the company?&rdquo;
Dorothy asked of one boy who was
larger than his companions, and who had not been
so ready to make fun of the unfortunates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&rsquo;s gone back home I guess, that is if
they has homes&mdash;some&rsquo;s hanging &rsquo;round the
hotel, where their trunks was attached as soon as
the baggage man brought &rsquo;em in&mdash;some&rsquo;s sitting
around on the benches in the green. Guess none
of &rsquo;em had any dinner to-day, for them hotel people
is as mean as dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hotel, over there,&rdquo; answered the
boy, pointing to a building on the opposite corner.
&ldquo;Mansion House, they call it, though I never
could see much of a mansion about that old barn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>The afternoon was wearing away and Dorothy
felt that she must make all possible haste if she
was to get back to North Birchland that night, as
she knew she must for her own sake. So, thanking
the boy she hurried over to the hotel, and,
after making some inquiries of a number of
loungers on the broad, low veranda, was directed
to the office.</p>
<p>She asked some questions regarding the whereabouts
of members of the theatrical company, but
the man at the dingy old desk was inclined to
make inquiries himself, rather than answer Dorothy&rsquo;s.
He wanted to know if she had called to
settle up for any of the &ldquo;guys&rdquo; and if not he
demanded to know if she took him for a bureau of
information or a public phonograph, and he
grinned delightfully at his feeble wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keep tabs on every barn-storming theatrical
company,&rdquo; he growled out. &ldquo;Much as I
kin do to look after their baggage and see they
don&rsquo;t skin me&mdash;that&rsquo;s my game in a case like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy pleaded with him to give her any information
he might have as to the whereabouts
of any girl or woman member of the company,
but he was ugly, evidently because of the loss of
some money or patronage in connection with the
theatrical fiasco, and would not give so much as
an encouraging word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Dorothy looked about but could see no one who
seemed to be an actor or actress. She had
learned in a measure to know the type. Fairly
sick and disheartened she turned away. How
could she give up now, when she felt that Tavia
must be almost within hearing of her voice?
How loudly her heart cried out! Surely some
kind fate would bear that cry to Tavia&rsquo;s ear and
bring her to her friend Dorothy&mdash;for now Dorothy
felt that she could hardly go many steps farther
in her weary search.</p>
<p>She heard a train steam into the station and go
on without making a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Dorothy, &ldquo;if we could only
get a train back again soon! But I can not give
her up! I must&mdash;must find her wherever she
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exhausted and discouraged, she sank down by
the roadside at a grassy spot where the street
turned into a country park. She felt that she
must cry&mdash;she would feel better when she had
cried&mdash;out there alone&mdash;away from the cruel
persons&mdash;away from the seemingly cruel fate
that was so relentlessly urging her on beyond her
strength&mdash;beyond the actual power of human
endurance. Was there ever so wretched a girl as
was Dorothy Dale at that moment? Yes, she
would indulge in a good cry&mdash;she knew it would
relieve her nerves&mdash;and then she could go on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>The rough boys, playing nearby saw the girl
sitting beside the road and, whether out of kindness
or curiosity they hastened over to the place
and stood looking down at Dorothy in respectful
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they do anyt&rsquo;ing to youse?&rdquo; asked a little
fellow with a ring of vengeance in his small, shrill
voice. &ldquo;Dem hotel guys is too fresh, an&rsquo; me
fader is goin&rsquo;&mdash;he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; do somet&rsquo;ing to dem
if dey don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; spoke up another. &ldquo;His fader
is de sheriff an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; &rsquo;rest &rsquo;em, if dey don&rsquo;t
pay der own bills, fer all der talk of holdin&rsquo; de
show trunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy raised her head. Surely these boys
were trying to comfort her in their own rough but
earnest way. Perhaps they could help her look
for Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do any of you know where the girls of this
company are now?&rdquo; she asked of the boys collectively.
&ldquo;I am searching for a girl with brown
hair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>She stopped abruptly, realizing how useless it
would be to give these boys a description of Tavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sawr a girl wit a big kind of a hat and a
little satchel, an&rsquo; I know she was wit de show,&rdquo; volunteered
a red-haired urchin. &ldquo;I was right alongside
of her when she bought five cents&rsquo; wort&rsquo; of
cakes at Rooney&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; after dat I seen her sittin&rsquo;
on a bench in de green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; asked an older boy severely, turning
to the one who had given the information.
&ldquo;No kiddin&rsquo; now, Signal, or we&rsquo;ll blow out your
red light,&rdquo; this reference being to the boy&rsquo;s brilliant
hair. &ldquo;We want t&rsquo; help dis gurl t&rsquo; find de young
lady, don&rsquo;t we fellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came in a ready chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did see her,&rdquo; protested Signal, rubbing his
hand over his fiery locks and rumpling them up
until they looked like a brush heap ablaze. &ldquo;I
sawr her less &rsquo;n hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Dorothy, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a bench in de green.&rdquo; And the lad
pointed out the direction to Dorothy.</p>
<p>She followed the road to the end and there,
stretching out before her was an open common, or
the green, as the boys called it. In the centre was
a little park, where a pretty fountain sent a spray
of sparkling water high into the air. Arranged
about it were benches, under shady bowers formed
by overhanging bushes, and there were clumps of
shrubbery that separated the seats, and concealed
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Dorothy walked straight to the fountain. She
sank down on a bench where she could watch the
spurting water and listen to the cool tinkle as it
fell into the basin. The sun shone through the
spray, making a small rainbow.</p>
<p>It looked like a sign of hope, but she was too
discouraged and dispirited to place much faith in
it. She wanted to see Tavia; yet where was she?
Here was the park the boys had spoken of, but
there was no sign of the missing girl.</p>
<p>Dorothy felt she could not stay there long.
After a few minutes&rsquo; rest she arose to make a circuit
of the little park, hoping she might have overlooked
some spot where Tavia might be. As she
crossed back of a clump of shrubbery she saw the
skirt of a girl&rsquo;s dress showing on the border of a
little side path. It riveted her attention. She
turned down the path.</p>
<p>There sat a girl&mdash;a most forlorn looking girl&mdash;her
head buried in her arms that rested on the
back of a bench. Dorothy could see her shoulders
heaving under the stress of heavy sobs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>She started! She held her breath! It looked
like&mdash;yet could it be her&mdash;was it&mdash;she feared
to ask herself the question.</p>
<p>The girl on the bench raised her tear-stained
face. She looked full at Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia!&rdquo; screamed Dorothy, springing forward.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p222.jpg" alt="&ldquo;TAVIA!&rdquo; SCREAMED DOROTHY, SPRINGING FORWARD" width="500" height="692" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;TAVIA!&rdquo; SCREAMED DOROTHY, SPRINGING FORWARD</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; echoed Tavia.</p>
<p>There was a rush, and the next instant Dorothy
Dale held Tavia clasped close in her arms, while
she murmured, over and over again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia! Dear Tavia! I have found you at
last! Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavia could only sob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SECRET&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>It was some moments before either girl was
able to speak after that first burst of emotion and
surprise. But Dorothy was too happy to remain
long in tears&mdash;even tears of joy that for the moment
had overcome her.</p>
<p>Tavia was pale, and her eyes were red from
much weeping. Her unhappy plight was apparent
at a glance, and this was incentive enough to
cause Dorothy to again clasp her in her arms and
hug her tighter than ever. She had forgotten
her own physical weakness now that she had
found Tavia, and she felt that she must hasten to
get her dear friend into a state of mind that might
help her to forget the sad experiences she had
passed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavia! Tavia, dear,&rdquo; whispered Dorothy,
as the girl fell again to weeping, &ldquo;do look up and
forget it all&mdash;for my sake, do. I have searched
so long for you, but now I have found you. Come
with me and we&rsquo;ll be just the same as we always
were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can I?&rdquo; cried the miserable girl.
&ldquo;Who will look at me now? How can I ever
face the folks again? Oh, Dorothy, let me go
away forever! I can not bear the disgrace!&rdquo;
and she moaned pitifully in her bitter anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tavia, you really meant nothing wrong,&rdquo;
said Dorothy taking the trembling hands in her
own which were scarcely less agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never meant to do wrong,&rdquo; spoke Tavia,
lifting her head with her old, proud bearing.
&ldquo;I broke my promise to you&mdash;I listened to that
girl in Rochester&mdash;she gave me a letter to a
theatrical manager in Buffalo. I only wanted to
make a name for myself&mdash;to gratify my ambition&mdash;I
wanted to earn money to get back to school&mdash;you
know we had no more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor darling!&rdquo; whispered Dorothy.
&ldquo;Was that it? Don&rsquo;t worry so. No one will
ever know. I have not told even Nat, and we
will keep it a secret between us forever. Do
come with me, dear,&rdquo; as Tavia appeared to look
brighter. &ldquo;I must get to North Birchland to-night&mdash;Oh,
if you ever knew the time I had getting
away from the boys!&rdquo; And she went on
hurriedly for several minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And did you come all the way alone, Dorothy
Dale? You have saved me in spite of myself!&rdquo;
declared Tavia, almost tragically. &ldquo;Yes,
I will go back. I can look them all in the face,
for I only tried to work and I did not mean to
deceive any one longer than would be necessary
for me to get a start. But now, Dorothy, I have
had enough of it. Where do you want me to
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t as nice as you thought it would
be?&rdquo; asked Dorothy, anxious to hear some of
Tavia&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice?&rdquo; There was no concealing the disgust
in Tavia&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It was awful, Dorothy!
It was a regular barn-storming company! Playing
one-night stands! We never had good houses.
They said it was because it was the summer season,
but I guess it was because the play was so
poor. We did not get all our salaries and half
the time didn&rsquo;t have enough to eat. Then the
show &lsquo;busted&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good&mdash;part I believe they
call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good part? Say, Doro,&rdquo; and Tavia actually
seemed her old self again. &ldquo;I had an idea
I was to be Lady Rossmore, or at least one of the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! I was Lucy, the parlor
maid, and the only time I was on the stage was
when I was dusting the make-believe furniture.
And as for my lines&mdash;well, I had a very heavy
and strong thinking part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tavia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my theatrical experience,&rdquo; answered
Tavia. &ldquo;Oh, Doro, I&rsquo;m very miserable,&rdquo; she
wailed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear. Dry your eyes now, you&rsquo;re
all right. I&rsquo;m&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy that I have
found you again. Come back to the station with
me. I have some one else to bring home, too.
Urania, the Gypsy girl&mdash;you remember her at
Glenwood, I guess&mdash;she has been trying to see
the world and she caught too big a glimpse of it.
Poor girl, she is quite sick and miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they hurried from the park, Dorothy
told Tavia of the trouble she had to get Urania
on the train. A happy thought came to Tavia,
and, with a bright smile she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it! In this little hand bag&mdash;all the
baggage I have left by the way&mdash;I have a very
quiet suit. I used it in the play, for sometimes I
had to take two or three parts if one of the other
girls was ill, but they never amounted to much&mdash;the
parts I mean. We can put this suit on
Urania.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Being thus able to help some one else worse off
than herself seemed to do Tavia good for her
kind heart always prompted her to acts of this
sort. It was a step back into the old life.</p>
<p>At the station they found Urania all excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young men were here!&rdquo; she exclaimed to
Dorothy, &ldquo;and they have gone off to look for you.
I didn&rsquo;t dare speak to them, but I peeked out and
I heard the station man tell them where he had
seen you go to, and they flew off again in their
dust-wagon like mad. Oh, Miss, I wish they had
found you, and they looked so tired and hardly
spoke like I&rsquo;ve always heard &rsquo;em, so polite and
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned and Nat here in Rockdale!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy, overjoyed at the news. &ldquo;Here, Urania,
you go in that little room and put these things
on you&rsquo;ll find in this bag,&rdquo; and she handed the
Gypsy Tavia&rsquo;s little valise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help her,&rdquo; volunteered Tavia, glad to be
of service to Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember, Tavia,&rdquo; said Dorothy in a
low tone, &ldquo;whoever we meet now I&rsquo;m to do all
the talking. This is my big secret and you must
let me take care of it. Have you any baggage&mdash;Oh,
I forgot, all the baggage of the company is
held for debts, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; replied Tavia promptly. &ldquo;All
I have is in my valise. It was so small they let
me keep it. They only wanted trunks and I didn&rsquo;t
have any. I travel light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry now and get Urania ready,&rdquo; said
Dorothy. She walked over toward the door of
the ladies&rsquo; waiting room. Suddenly she fancied
she heard&mdash;yes&mdash;sure enough that was the toot
of the Fire Bird&rsquo;s horn!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tavia!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Here they come!
Hurry! Hurry Urania! Tavia! We must all
be out there together when they come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the automobile swept up to the station
in a cloud of dust. Out on the platform hurried
Dorothy, Tavia and Urania, the latter smiling
broadly in her new outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I give up!&rdquo; exclaimed Nat, the first to
alight from the panting car. &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t
given us a merry chase, Dorothy! We got worried
after you left us and we traced you from place
to place. Thought sure we&rsquo;d lost you here. Oh,
it was a merry chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad it was merry,&rdquo; exclaimed Tavia, forgetting
that Dorothy was to do all the talking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should say it was,&rdquo; put in Ned, &ldquo;and
she skipped off to meet you without giving us a
hint&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ned, don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; said Dorothy
sweetly. &ldquo;See what a large party you have to
take home. And you must not scold the girls, for
we have as much right as you boys have to take
little trips together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were too well pleased to argue or be
angry. In fact, they had had a very miserable time
of it since Dorothy &ldquo;escaped,&rdquo; as they called it.
Now, they wanted nothing better than to get into
the machine with the girls and make all speed for
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you room for Urania?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.
&ldquo;Can she stand up between the seats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; assented Ned. &ldquo;Plenty
of room. Get aboard everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get under the seat,&rdquo; protested the
Gypsy girl. &ldquo;That was the way I came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was!&rdquo; said Nat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten
about you, young lady. She&rsquo;s the girl,&rdquo; he
went on, turning to the others, &ldquo;who stole a ride
with me the day I went into Dalton, Dorothy.
She actually rode under the back seat where she&rsquo;d
hidden in the night. She made the noise we
thought was a burglar, you know. She gave me
the slip, though, when I went to take her back, so
now she must ride in the open, where I can keep
my eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Urania! You said&mdash;&rdquo; began Dorothy,
thinking of what the Gypsy girl had said about
Nat taking her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t be hard on me,&rdquo; pleaded
Urania. &ldquo;I was so miserable I didn&rsquo;t know what
I was saying. It&rsquo;s true, just as he says, and it&rsquo;s
all my fault. I ran away. He didn&rsquo;t take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy climbed in beside Ned. Tavia was in
her usual seat with Nat. Then Urania squatted
down, in true Gypsy fashion, on the floor of the
car at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll just about make it after all,&rdquo;
commented Ned, as he turned on the power more
fully and threw in the clutch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re due home
about seven, but we&rsquo;ll have to speed it up a bit to
do it. Lucky it&rsquo;s nearly level all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we do get home,&rdquo; put in Nat, &ldquo;you
girls will just have to own up and tell the whole
story. No serial for ours. We want it complete
in one number.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to tell you
a single word. We&rsquo;ll get home about on time,
according to agreement, and you have no reason
to find a single bit of fault. Tavia will come to
North Birchland just as she promised to early in
the season. She&rsquo;s been too busy to come before,&rdquo;
and Dorothy smiled. &ldquo;And if we do have our
own affairs to talk about you must not expect to
know everything. Girls have to have secrets, or
they wouldn&rsquo;t be girls, and we have now got ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tavia in a low voice with a loving
look at her chum, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dorothy&rsquo;s great secret
and I guess I&rsquo;ll help her keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here, as they are speeding toward North
Birchland, we will take leave of Dorothy, Tavia
and the boys for a while. Dorothy kept the secret,
as did Tavia, and no one ever knew the real
meaning of Tavia&rsquo;s absence, nor why Dorothy was
so anxious to find her. The theatrical venture
was never disclosed, thanks to Dorothy&rsquo;s tact and
abilities, for she showed that she could manage
some things even better than could her cousins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a glorious trip to Buffalo after
all,&rdquo; was Nat&rsquo;s comment, as they neared North
Birchland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; agreed Dorothy. Then she fell
to wondering if she would ever again have so
many adventures. Little did she dream of what
the future held in store, as will be related in another
story, which I shall call, &ldquo;Dorothy Dale and
Her Chums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running some, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Ned, as the
Fire Bird whizzed over the country road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; faltered Tavia. Then
she turned to whisper to Dorothy. &ldquo;I am so
thankful to leave the&mdash;that behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy only smiled, but that smile showed that
she understood perfectly.</p>
